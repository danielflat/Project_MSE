So let’s make an effort to save valuable energy and resources. And a positive contribution to the environment. An initiative by Invest your energy in climate protection We are determined to reduce our energy consumption, together with you and all residents of student halls. Because saving energy is one of the most effective things you can do to reduce your carbon footprint and slow global warming. So play your part – out of love for the environment. Using energy efficiently We know it’s not always easy to save energy. And yet there are dozens of small lifestyle changes that will be enough to make a difference. We want to take a more conscious approach to how we use energy – with our heating, water and electricity. Together, we can make a long-term impact. Small steps make a big impact There are plenty of small ways in which you can save energy on a daily basis. It’s the simple things that make all the difference. And when everyone plays their part, major change is possible. It’s time to take action. Let’s flip the switch! To the energy-saving tips The #myenergychallenge Are you up to the challenge? Share your personal energy-saving challenge to Instagram in reels and stories using the hashtag #myenergychallenge. And don’t forget to tag and nominate your flatmates, friends and followers. After all, we’re in this together! Instagram Every challenge has major energy-saving potential When showering, you use approx. 15 to 20 litres of hot water per minute. The colder the water and the quicker you shower can make all the difference. Approximately 10% of your annual electricity bill goes on lighting. So switch off the lights when leaving a room and make the most of the daylight for as long as possible. One hour spent streaming a Full HD video consumes between 0.22 and 0.37 kWh. Avoid binge watching and switch off screens. Not using a hairdryer every day could save you up to €20 a year. Let your hair dry naturally instead. Reducing the temperature in a room by one degree can lead to approx. 6% savings on heating costs. So turn down the heating and don’t forget to open those windows and ventilate the room. Water boils quicker and more efficiently using a kettle than the electric stove. Pay attention to the amount of water and only boil as much as you need. Test your energy knowledge! How far do you need to travel by bicycle (at a speed of 20 km/h) to generate one kilowatt hour? approx. 200 km approx. 500 km approx. 1.000 km New question Twenty energy-saving tips for everyday use Small tips to make a big impact: how to save valuable energy in your student accommodation. Saving energy in the (shared) kitchen Put a lid on every pot This will reduce the energy consumed when cooking by approx. 50%. And save you plenty of time. Use the fan oven instead of top and bottom heat You’ll use approx. 15% less energy when baking. Preheat the oven? Don’t bother! And use approx. 20% less electricity. 7 °C is cold enough for all types of food For every degree warmer that you set your fridge, it will use approx. 6% less electricity. The 3-second rule applies for the fridge door It shouldn’t be left open for longer than this. Because for every minute the door is open, a fridge needs approx. 5 minutes plus additional energy to bring the temperature back down again. Use a kettle instead of the electric stove: It’s a more efficient and quicker way to boil water. With a kettle, you’ll save approx. 30% more energy for 1.5 litres of water. Extra tip: Take note of the quantity. If you boil more water than necessary, energy and CO2 emissions increase unnecessarily. Cook together Cook together with your flatmates, your neighbours or your friends more often. It’s a fun thing to do and minimises use of the cooker and other kitchen appliances. Go to the canteen When cooking or baking for an hour, your cooker alone uses between one and three kWh of electricity, depending on its energy efficiency rating. This figure does not include the use of additional kitchen appliances. You are saving energy and money that would been spent on groceries by going to eat in the canteen. Defrost the freezer compartment The thicker the layer of ice in the freezer compartment, the more energy your refrigerator consumes. When defrosting, simply remove all food, switch off the fridge and, where necessary, use salt to help melt the ice. Store food in the fridge correctly Your fridge performs best when full. When stocking up the fridge, make sure you pay attention to the temperature zones: the bottom of the fridge is the coldest part, with the temperature getting warmer the higher up you go. The shelves in the door are where it is warmest. Saving energy in the (shared) living room Heating done right: reducing the temperature in a room by just one degree can save you approx. 6% on your heating costs. Ventilate the room occasionally i.e. turn off the heating and leave the windows wide open for several minutes. This will allow for an exchange of air in the room, while the furniture and walls retain the heat. Three times a day for five minutes is enough during the winter. Pull down the shutters in the evening: this will reduce heat loss by approx. 20%. Close the door(s)! By closing all the doors in your accommodation, you can reduce heat loss by up to 5%. Bye bye, stand-by! Multiple plugs with switches can be used to turn off electrical devices completely and use approx. 8% less power. Pull the plug: remove your chargers from the wall when you’re not using them. Use a laptop instead of a PC: a laptop in normal operation needs less than half as much power as a multimedia PC. Tablets and smartphones are even more economical: the electricity costs come to just a few euros each year for charging the new devices. Switch on energy-saving mode Set the screen brightness, automatic power shut-off or sleep mode on your devices for power savings of up to 10%. Move furniture around Particularly in small rooms, cleverly arranging your furniture pays off. Positioning your desk or couch directly in front of the heating will lead to an accumulation of heat and prevent the thermostat from regulating the temperature correctly. This could see the amount of heat you consume increase by up to 24%. TV nights together Gather round and watch your favourite series together with flatmates, neighbours or friends instead of sitting alone in front of the TV or laptop. The more people getting together, the more energy saved. Go out more often It generally applies that the less time spent at home, the less energy is consumed there. After class, why not visit a friend, play some sport or simply enjoy being out and about – make the most of your time in third-level study. Saving energy in the (shared) bathroom Water-saving shower head: air is mixed with the water and water consumption is reduced by approx. 50%. Shower colder, for shorter periods and with breaks: if you shower at 37 °C instead of 40 °C, energy savings of up to 10% are possible. And you can simply turn off the water while applying shampoo or when shaving. Wash your hands with cold water: soap works at colder temperatures too. Avoid using the hairdryer or towel dry your hair well beforehand: good for your hair and for the environment. Hang up the washing: a dryer emits up to 84 kg CO2 each year – be more climate neutral. 30 °C for clean laundry: when you do two washing cycles per week at 30 °C instead of 60 °C, you could save up to €17 on your heating costs each year. Save energy when studying Charge smart Universities and libraries often have workspaces with power outlets. Charge your smartphone, tablet or laptop here instead of at home. In some cities, you can even charge your devices on the train. Study in the library When you leave your apartment to study elsewhere, you are not only going somewhere less distracting but also saving on the power and heating consumed at home. Switch off Wi-Fi at night Routers and repeaters require lots of energy to send the Wi-Fi signal. Switch off the signal at night and save electricity. Use recycled paper Use recycled paper or your laptop for taking notes in class. Recycled paper requires less energy and water to manufacture. Print less Many learning materials at university will be provided in digital form. Only print them out if you really need to. By not printing, you’ll save energy and paper. Saving energy on a daily basis Second-hand shopping Buy and sell clothing, electrical appliances, books and furniture at flea markets or online. You’ll be protecting the climate and saving yourself money. Be aware of energy efficiency When purchasing new or used electrical devices, pay attention to the energy consumption. Check the energy label; the device will be rated from A to G, with A being most efficient and G the least. Empty batteries Wait until your battery-powered devices, such as your smartphone or electrical toothbrush, are almost empty before charging them. Leaving them plugged in with a full battery means they’ll be continuously consuming electricity.

We closely collaborate with experimental researchers from various disciplines. We are particularly interested in applications in the neurosciences: We build data-driven mechanistic models of neuronal functions in order to understand how neuronal networks in the brain process sensory information and control intelligent behaviour.

Information for research alumni Alumni stories Supporting and empowering women - that fascinates me! "Over the three months, I built close and intense relationships with the crew members and the refugee women. It was a shared journey of empowerment in which we strengthened each other, regardless of our cultural backgrounds. My farewell was also very emotional. At that moment, I really realized once again how important it is that there are people who are committed to the work of ROSA e.V. and the refugee women." In the interview, Anna Gärtner, who has a degree in midwifery and women's health, talks about her career as a midwife and her commitment to ROSA e.V. - Rolling Safespace for refugee women in Greece.

Many of our scientific findings have laid essential foundations in AI research and will continue to shape this discipline in the future. In addition to the four research departments Computational Neuroscience (Director: Peter Dayan), Body-Brain Cybernetics (Director: Ivan de Araujo), High Field Magnetic Resonance (Max Planck Fellow: Klaus Scheffler) and Sensory & Sensorimotor Systems (Max Planck Fellow: Li Zhaoping), there are several independent research groups. Departments Computational Neuroscience Director: Dr. Peter Dayan One of the research focuses of this department is the question of how the brain makes decisions. To this end, it creates various forms of learning with theoretical models, including so-called reinforcement learning. Based on statistical and programming methods, the scientists can simulate learning and decision-making processes on the computer. They are also analyzing how impaired decision-making can lead to disorders such as depression, addiction as well as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and personality disorders. In this way, they want to combine the psychological and neuronal view of such disorders and thereby learn more about the causes, classification and possible treatment of these diseases. Body-Brain Cybernetics Director: Dr. Ivan de Araujo The Body-Brain Cybernetics Department aims to study the neural connections that enable communication between the brain and various organs in the body. The long-term goal is to develop ways to tap into neural circuits in order to overcome emotional and immunological disorders. The department of Body-Brain Cybernetics will dive into deciphering how we could take hold of brain circuits to influence our body. This includes situations like neurodegenerative disease, when body parts don’t function appropriately due to disconnections between body and brain. Sensory and sensorimotor systems Lead: Prof. Dr. Zhaoping Li The Department of Sensory and Sensorimotor Systems, we also call it the Natural Intelligence Lab, became part of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in October 2018. It is led by Prof. Dr. Zhaoping Li. Her research aims to identify and understand how the brain receives and processes sensory stimuli (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory), and how it subsequently uses this information to control body movements and make cognitive decisions. High-field Magnetic Resonance Lead: Prof. Dr. Klaus Scheffler Our goal is to develop and apply novel magnetic resonance techniques at very high field strengths to study the anatomical and functional microstructure of the brain. We want to understand how physiological processes and microstructures affect the measured nuclear magnetic resonance signal and how these magnetic fingerprints can be used to measure thought processes and brain activation. Magnetic resonance imaging is currently the only method that can capture thought processes of the entire human brain with a spatial resolution of 1 millimeter and a temporal resolution of 1 second using ultra-high magnetic fields. Research Groups Dynamic Cognition Group Research Group Leader: Dr. Assaf Breska Our research combines the domains of time-related knowledge processing, learning, attention, and predictive action with the goal of developing a neurocognitive model of dynamic knowledge processing. We are interested in how perception, cognition, and action are interrelated within a temporal coordinate system and how anticipatory information processing in the brain incorporates the time aspect along with other dimensions. Systems Neuroscience & Neuroengineering Research Group Leaders: Jennifer Li, PhD, Drew Robson, PhD The joint lab of Drew Robson and Jennifer Li is developing new imaging techniques to map the neural activity of free-swimming zebrafish at the larval stage. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for motivation and attention in the brain. The research group investigates the state-dependent regulation of decision-making processes in the brain during natural behaviors such as navigation, foraging, and operant learning. The interplay of neuromodulatory systems and brain states is of particular interest. Translational Sensory and Circadian Neuroscience Research Group Leader: Dr. Manuel Spitschan The Max Planck Research Group Translational Sensory and Circadian Neuroscience aims to understand the effects of light on human physiology and behaviour. Light influences our physiology and behaviour. For example, exposure to light at night can suppress the production of the hormone melatonin and shift our endogenous circadian rhythm. Light being a major influence on the human circadian system – and specifically its associated negative effects in the evening and a night – the modification of light exposure is an interesting target for interventions. Computational Principles of Intelligence Research Group Leader: Dr. Eric Schulz We are an interdisciplinary research group that develops computational models of human intelligence. Our goal is to build formal theories of how people generalize from little data, explore efficiently, and find approximate solutions to complex problems. We build precise and powerful models of people's cognitive abilities, combining psychology, machine learning, and neuroscience. We use interactive games, large data sets, online and lab experiments to study how people learn and explore. Brain States for Plasticity Research Group Leader: Dr. Svenja Brodt The Brain States for Plasticity Group aims to understand how information is encoded and stored in the human brain and how different brain states shape this process. Main interests are the rapid neocortical memory formation, as well as memory formation and consolidation during sleep. Moreover, the lab explores noninvasive and in vivo possibilities to infer the location in which mnemonic content is stored in humans. Cognitive Neuroscience & Neurotechnology Research Group Leader: Dr. Romy Lorenz Our lab focuses on advancing our understanding of the frontoparietal brain network mechanisms that underpin high-level cognition and adaptive behaviour. We pursue an interdisciplinary research programme that allows studying this brain system at multiple levels of granularity. Our methodology involves subject-specific brain-computer interface technology, fMRI at 3T and ultra-high (i.e., 7T and 9.4T) magnetic field strengths (for resolving cortical layers), EEG, non-invasive brain stimulation as well as computational modelling and machine learning. Molecular Signaling Research Group Leader: Dr. Robert Ohlendorf This lab aims at understanding how molecular signals shape complex biological systems such as the mammalian brain. To this end, they develop and apply methods that visualize signaling molecules in the brain in real-time and allow to see their interplay. Combining different state-of-the-art imaging approaches, they study fundamental molecular aspects of mammalian brain function in model organisms and deduce implications for healthy and pathological states of the human brain. The group also uses synthetic biology and protein engineering to develop new tools for measuring and controlling biological processes.

The Max Planck Institute for Biology Tübingen (until the end of 2021: Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology) is concerned with the development and evolution of animals and plants. The institute's scientists investigate how a functional organism develops from a fertilized egg cell and which genes are involved. In addition, they are analyzing the role of these developmental processes in the formation of new species as well as the evolution of proteins. To find answers to their questions, the researchers are working with so-called model organisms such as zebrafish, fruit flies, nematodes and thale cress, a relative of cabbage plants. Indeed, genes that influence development have been shown to function in a similar way in different organisms - whether flies and humans or thale cress and rice. Abteilungen Microbiome Science Director: Prof. Ruth Ley, PhD In the Department of Microbiome Science we ask fundamental questions about the evolutionary origins of the human gut microbiome and how it influences host physiology and evolution. We have the following main areas of research: evolution of the human gut microbiome and interplay with host genetics, lipids in host-microbiome symbiosis, microbiota-innate immune interactions, ecology and evolution of host-associated methanogens, and host phenotype effects of heritable microbiota. Algal Development and Evolution Director: Prof. Dr. Susana Coelho Our research focuses on the origin, evolution, and regulation of sexual systems diversity and on the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie the complex developmental patterns and reproductive features in brown algae. Brown algae have been evolving independently of animals and land plants for more than a billion years. During that time, they have become the third most developmentally complex lineage on the planet. They also exhibit a fascinating range of types of sexual life cycles and sex determination systems. This extraordinary group of eukaryotes is expected to provide fundamental insights into the processes underlying the evolution of complex multicellular life. Protein Evolution Director: Prof. Dr. Andrei Lupas Proteins are essential building blocks of all living cells; indeed, life can be viewed as resulting substantially from the chemical activity of proteins. Because of their importance, it is hardly surprising that ancestors for most proteins observed today were already present at the time of the 'last common ancestor', a primordial organism from which all life on Earth is descended. How did the first proteins arise? How does their sequence of amino acids enable their chemical activity? These questions are at the center of our scientific efforts at our Department of Protein Evolution. Integrative Evolutionary Biology Director: Prof. Dr. Ralf J. Sommer We link development, ecology, and population genetics in a highly integrative approach to study how novel and complex traits evolve as a result of historical processes. We focus on developmental (phenotypic) plasticity as a facilitator for the evolution of novelty, complex traits, and phenotypic divergence. Molecular Biology Director: Prof. Dr. Dr. h. c. mult. Detlef Weigel The long-term goal at our research department is to understand both the molecular mechanisms and the evolution of adaptive traits. To this end, we are using both phenotype-first and genotype-first approaches to identify genetic variants with a potential role in local, regional or global adaptation. Such studies benefit tremendously from knowledge about the genomes of other species, as well from a historical perspective that exploits ancient DNA methods to unlock the knowledge stored in herbaria. One of our lines of research, on fitness tradeoffs, is now being supported through a grant from the ERC. Research groups Plant Pathogen Evolution Research Group Leader: Dr. Honour McCann We investigate disease emergence in agricultural systems, focusing on bacterial infectious diseases caused by Pseudomonas syringae and more recently, Ralstonia solanacearum. We use population genomics and phylogeographic inference to reconstruct the direction and timing of migration events, identify outbreak origins and detect host shift or host range expansion events. Ciliate genomics and molecular biology Research group leader: Dr. Estienne Swart This research group is pursuing research in ciliates, a diverse group of eukaryotic microbes. In these organisms, a sophisticated developmental process transforms a copy of their germline genome into a somatic one. Most of the research into this process has taken place in just a few model ciliate species and has just begun scratching the surface of the underlying mechanisms. We have been taking a comparative approach to investigate these processes both in a classical model (Paramecium tetraurelia), and in a couple new, distantly related ciliate species (Loxodes magnus and Blepharisma stoltei). Mutualisms Research Group Leader: Dr. Hassan Salem Numerous adaptations in animals are a direct consequence of symbiosis. We are interested in the evolutionary processes that shape mutually beneficial species interactions, with emphasis on why they form and how they are maintained. Among the most pervasive and streamlined symbioses found in nature are the mutualisms forged between herbivorous insects and bacteria. Research in the lab involves studying herbivore-microbe interactions across multiple biological scales to characterize the currencies that define these partnerships, and describe the developmental profiles contributing to their persistence.

Three subdomains - perception, learning and action - can be differentiated in this context. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems are dedicated to the fundamental research and development of intelligent systems in all three subdomains. Research expertise in the fields of computer and material sciences as well as biology are combined in one institute at two locations. Machine learning, image recognition, robotics and biological systems will be investigated in Tübingen; so-called learning material systems, micro- and nanorobotics and self-organization in Stuttgart. Although the focus is on basic research, the institute has high potential for practical applications, including robotics, medical technology and innovative technologies based on new materials. Abteilungen Empirical Inference Director: Prof. Dr. Bernhard Schölkopf The type of inference can vary, including for instance inductive learning (estimation of models such as functional dependencies that generalize to novel data sampled from the same underlying distribution), or the inference of causal structures from statistical data (leading to models that provide insight into the underlying mechanisms, and make predictions about the effect of interventions). Likewise, the type of empirical data can vary, ranging from sparse experimental measurements (e. g., microarray data) to visual patterns. Our department is conducting theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental studies to try and understand the problem of empirical inference. Haptic Intelligence Director: Katherine J. Kuchenbecker, PhD We leverage scientific knowledge about the sense of touch to create haptic interfaces that enable a user to interact with virtual objects and distant environments as though they were real and within reach. One key insight in this endeavor has been that tactile cues, such as high-frequency tool vibrations and the making and breaking of contact, convey rich mechanical information that is necessary to make the interaction feel real. This research led us to realize that autonomous robots can also benefit from attending to the dynamic tactile cues that occur as they manipulate objects in their environment and engage in social physical interaction with humans. Perceiving Systems Director: Michael Black, PhD Our research uses Computer Vision to learn digital humans that can perceive, learn, and act in virtual 3D worlds. This involves capturing the shape, appearance, and motion of real people as well as their interactions with each other and the 3D scene using monoculr video. We leverage this to learn generative models of people and their behavior and evaluate these models by synthesizing realistic looking humans behaving in virtual worlds. This work combines Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Computer Graphics. Robotic Materials Director: Prof. Dr. Christoph Kepplinger Dr. Keplinger’s research focuses on fundamentally challenging current limitations of materials and components used to build robots. He is regarded as a pioneer in the field of bio-inspired soft robotics and a rising star in the international robotics and materials science communities. As an MPI-IS director, he has founded the new “Robotic Materials” department. Dr. Keplinger will have a decisive influence on the future development of the institute as well as on the excellence of Cyber Valley, Europe’s largest research consortium in the field of AI. Social Foundation of Computation Director: Prof. Dr. Moritz Hardt Moritz Hardt founded the department "Social Foundations of Computation" in 2021, which extends the institute's deep expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics, and physical systems to include social issues within computer science. The research is intended to contribute to a paradigm shift within computer science that treats computer science from the ground up as a social science that takes into account the role of society as a whole, as well as the actions and dynamic behavior of individuals - especially when algorithms have an impact on the reality of people's lives.

The FML is part of the Max Planck Campus Tübingen, which is also home to the Max Planck Institutes for Biology Tübingen, for Biological Cybernetics and for Intelligent Systems. The research groups at the FML are currently working on various aspects of biology. Research groups Evolutionary Genomics of Complex Traits Research Group Leader: Dr. Luisa F. Pallares Our research focuses on understanding the genetic basis of between-individual variation in complex traits and how such complex genetic architectures, instead of being static properties of a trait, get re-shaped when populations are exposed to different environments (genotype-by-environment interactions or GxE). In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how phenotypic robustness is regulated in such traits. That is, we aim to understand not only why individuals in a population look different from each other, but also why some individuals are more vulnerable than others when exposed to perturbations like stressful or new environments. Structural Biochemistry of Meiosis Research Group Leader: Dr. John Weir We are engaged in biochemical studies that enable the crossing of genetic information in the test tube with synthetic DNA. For this, we will increasingly be able to use hybrid structural biological approaches and combine different methods to obtain as complete a picture as possible of the systems of interest to us. In doing so, we aim to address phenomena specific to vertebrate and, in particular, human meiosis. In the long term, we hope that our work could be of use to clinicians helping people with fertility problems or genetic diseases.

One particular focus is to bring machine learning research and neuroscience closer together. We use and develop machine learning approaches for analyzing the vast and complex datasets that are an integral part of modern neuroscience today. In addition, we use artificial neural systems as model systems for understanding what particular feats biological systems have evolved to achieve. Currently, the center conducts research in the following areas: Neural data analysis and machine learning for neuroscience Robust sensory processing in biological and artificial systems Quantitative psychophysics and computational psychiatry Neuroprosthetics and computational motor control Optimality principles in neuroscience Several joint research initiatives have been started at the BCCN: BMBF funding (2010-2017) The Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience was funded in 2010 thanks to generous funding provided by the German Ministry of Science and Education through the Bernstein Initiative. The goal of this initial phase of the center was to establish lasting structures in computational neuroscience in Tübingen and build a lively community bridging the gap between experimental neuroscience and machine learning.

Human visual perception is amazingly robust: Even in highly variable environments, we are able to make reliable inferences about the spatial arrangement of the world from limited visual information. To achieve this, our brain must perform complex computations. Artificial vision systems, in turn – as used, for example, in self-driving cars – are making steep progress in reproducing the visual skills of humans. The goal of this joint initiative will be to better understand the principles and algorithms that enable robust visual inference both in humans and machines. Topics, aims and projects Aim 1a: Generative and causal modeling Project 1: Physics-based scene understanding ( Gehler , Lensch ), ended with 1st funding period Project 2: Robust material inference ( Lensch ) Project 3: Comparing humans and machines on robust visual inference (Wallis, Bethge ), ended with 1st funding period Project 4: Causal inference strategies in human vision ( Wichmann , Bethge , Schölkopf ) Project 17: Learning explainable policies for self-driving cars from little data ( Akata , Geiger ) Aim 1b: Feedback and neural representations Project 5: Task–dependend top down modulation of visual processing ( von Luxburg , Franz , Dayan ) Project 6: Top-down control of visual inference in sensory representations in early visual cortex ( Macke , Sinz ) Project 7: Large-scale neuronal interactions during natural vision ( Siegel , Bartels ) Project 8: Integration of bottom-up and top-down processing in perceptual learning during sleep ( Rauss , Nienborg ), ended with 1st funding period Aim 2: Dynamic input Project 9: Natural dynamic scene processing in the human brain ( Bartels , Black ) Project 10: Natural stimuli for mice: environment statistics and neural representations in the early visual system ( Busse , Euler ) Project 11: Stable vision in the presence of fixational eye movements: where and how is the retinal image perceptually stabilized? ( Hafed , Franke ) Transferproject: Physiologically inspired robust electro-optical autofocals ( Wahl , Rifai) Aim 3: Precortical image transformations Project 12: Image processing within a locally complete retinal ganglion cell population ( Euler , Bethge ) Project 13: Visual processing of feedforward and feedback signals in the dLGN ( Busse , Berens ) Project 14: Image-processing computations in artificial vision ( Stingl , Zeck , Schwarz ) Central Information structure project: A collaborative data management platform for reproducible neuroscience and machine learning ( Sinz , Berens ) While the two images on the right show exactly the same scene, the pixel values on the left are very different due to the differences in lighting. For humans, this can be easily seen, but for artificial algorithms this is a challenging task. In the CRC, we study commonalities and differences between natural and artificial vision systems to find out the principles underlying robust visual processing.

Two groups at the Bernstein center (Bethge, Sinz) are part of a multi-university consortium funded by the MICrONs program within the Obama BRAINinitiative, that is setting out to narrow the gap between current state-of-the-art deep learning and algorithms of the mammalian visual system by exploring circuit level functional and anatomical patterns of populations of cortical neurons. The approach is guided by data collected from cortical networks across three hierarchically organized visual areas in a behaving mouse at an unprecedented scale and detail. Using two- and three-photon imaging the team is collecting the distributed patterns of neural activity in response to artificial and natural stimuli from nearly all ~100,000 neurons in 1mm 3 of cortex in vivo . The functional imaging is followed by dense electron-microscopy reconstruction of the connectome in the same tissue. Using this historic dataset, the team aims at a full characterization of the functional properties, morphology, and connectivity of all neurons in all six layers across three interconnected areas of the mammalian cortex, and the computations they implement.

Among the nine selected research consortia, three are located at the University of Tübingen, the University Hospital Tübingen and the NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tübingen - together they will receive approximately 1.5 million euros for a total of three years. Forschungsprogramm Neurobotik der Baden-Württemberg Stiftung The project " NeuroControl : Control of physiological activity in retinal neuronal networks " focuses on how activity in the neuronal networks of the retina can be controlled. Although retinal visual prostheses are clinically successful, their operation is still based on comparatively simple stimulation patterns. In RetNetControl, the research group of PD Dr. Philipp Berens (Research Institute of Ophthalmology, Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neurosciences and Bernstein Centre for Computational Neuroscience) intends to establish theoretical network models of retinal cells in order to test alternative stimulation patterns. Based on the model predictions, Dr. Günther Zeck's research group (Natural and Medical Sciences Institute Reutlingen NMI and Bernstein Centre for Computational Neuroscience) will use experimental laboratory experiments to investigate the extent to which such stimulation patterns can trigger responses in blind retinas that are comparable to those of healthy retinas. The insights gained can lead to an improvement in retinal implants and generally in invasive neurostimulators. Simulation framework for the retinal neuroprosthetics project. Figure by J. Oesterle.

For these patients, NemoPlast is developing a training neurorobot that links an exoskeleton with a non-invasive brain stimulator. The exoskeleton is controlled by brain activity (brain-machine interface) and can support paralysed persons during hand and arm movements. The brain stimulator simultaneously activates previously unused neuronal networks and connections between the brain and muscles in order to strengthen them in a targeted and sustained manner (closed-loop stimulation). This integrated neuroprosthetic training approach aims at promoting plasticity and restoring the motor functions of the patients so that they can in the long term perform independent movements without technical aids.

The researchers are developing a brain-controlled hand exoskeleton that can be used in everyday life, enabling paralysed people to grasp everyday objects and thus live more independently. Dr. Surjo Soekadar, head of the Applied Neurotechnology research group at the University Hospital of Tübingen and project coordinator, is sure that this will substantially improve the quality of life for paralysed persons. The control of the hand exoskeleton is based on a Brain/Neural-Computer Interaction (BNCI) system. The brain waves are measured at the head using polyamide electrodes and combined with other biosignals, for example from eye movements. The mere idea of a finger movement that leads to a characteristic brain current signal is translated into a control signal for the hand exoskeleton, which finally moves the paralysed hand in real time.

All visual information is broadcasted by an intra-retinal pathway formed by a group of neurons called bipolar cells. They collect photoreceptor signals in the outer retina and relay the signals to the inner retinal neurons. This transfer of visual information is far from passive: Each of the at least 10 bipolar cell types transforms the photoreceptor signals in a unique and highly specific way. As a result, the bipolar cell output signals form the first “elementary operations” from which the neural circuits of the inner retina compose a feature-oriented description of the visual world. Reflecting the partitioning of visual information into parallel channels, the retinal layer in which bipolar cell axon terminals meet their synaptic partners, is highly organized: This so-called “inner plexiform layer” effectively serves as the retina’s “switch board”: The input is provided by the different bipolar cell “channels”, while the output is carried by an even larger number of channels, represented by ganglion cells that form the optic nerve. Each of the ~20 ganglion cell types composes its feature-extracting circuits from a specific set of bipolar cell input it receives. Owing to its regular structure and ease of experimental access, the retina is amongst the best understood self-standing neuronal networks in neuroscience. Indeed, recent advances hold the exciting promise that an in-depth understanding of the bipolar cells – an entire class of neurons – and their role in the first critical steps of visual processing is within reach. The ITN trains young researchers in world-leading research labs towards completing this goal. We will accomplish this by exposing the students to a host of cutting-edge techniques and a broad spectrum of research approaches within the training network – from imaging at synaptic resolution, genetic models and retina degeneration to the application of retinal circuit principles for signal processing in artificial vision chips. The switchBoard consortium brings together partners from eight different countries, combining the expertise of seven academic institutions with excellent research and teaching records, one non-profit research organisation, and three fully integrated private sector partners. 3D reconstructions of two bipolar cell types based on electronmicroscopy data About us At the Bernstein Center Tübingen, scientists from various disciplines, including theoretical and experimental neurobiology, machine learning, and medicine, collaborate in order to analyze the basis of inference processes in the brain.

The goal of this initial phase of the center was to establish lasting structures in computational neuroscience in Tübingen and build a lively community bridging the gap between experimental neuroscience and machine learning. The projects of this first phase were targeted to uncover the neural mechanisms of perceptual inference. Our perception is not simply a copy of the sensory stimuli we receive, but an abstract interpretation of the world. Complex processing mechanisms, which combine the information of the sensory stimuli with specific knowledge about the physical properties of the world, enable this interpretation. An impressive illustration for this are Magic Eye pictures . From these abstract 2D patterns the brain reconstructs a 3rd dimension which we experience as depth perception. Such artificial examples demonstrate the specific inference capacities of the brain that are performed continuously in our everyday life, without us ever noticing. For example, we recognize objects and their properties independently of light condition or arrangement. In order to perform such inferences, relevant and persistent structures and patterns must be extracted from very complex datasets. The fact that our brain is able to do this apparently effortlessly is even more remarkable when one considers that no computer algorithm exists with nearly that capacity. Cluster A - Sensory Periphery: Coding Principals and Clinical Applications The selection of which information is relevant for perceptual inference begins at the early stages of the sensory periphery. Many perceptual impairments such as low vision originate from a dysfunction of the peripheral stages in the sensory pathways. Therefore, identifying the coding principles at the periphery is of great importance for understanding perceptual inference as well as for clinical applications. Furthermore, it is less affected by feedback from other brain regions which makes it more suitable for developing accurate quantitative models of the neural response properties and computations. The central research questions are: How do different retinal ganglion cell types collectively encode the visual information? To what extent is retinal processing adapted to statistical regularities of natural images? How does neural processing in the retina interact with tuning mechanisms controlling the optics of the eye? Which features of retinal ganglion cell population responses are critical for visual perception? How can we use the obtained insights for clinical applications? Cluster B - Population coding in the early sensory cortex The cortex is thought to be critical for integrating inputs from all primary sensory areas and for carrying out important computations underlying perceptual inference. Although there is extensive knowledge about how single cortical neurons operate in isolation, we do not know how to place this back into the context of an interconnected, operating system. Moreover, we do not know which algorithms are suitable to describe how the sensory input has been processed up to this stage. Here, we will work towards identifying these algorithms. To this end, we will investigate early cortical processing of perceptually relevant stimuli at the level of populations rather than single cells in awake, behaving animals making use of new technologies that allow simultaneous recordings from neuronal populations. As cortical representations are likely to share generic principles across sensory modalities, we will furthermore compare coding properties in primary visual, somatosensory, and auditory cortex. The central research questions are: Which interactions among cortical cells are critical for stimulus encoding and which are critical for triggering behaviour? To what extent can we predict the animals’ choice from the primary sensory cortex on a single trial basis? How stable is the neuronal representation of a stimulus from one trial to the next? How is prior knowledge about the natural sensory input stored and recalled in cortical representations? Cluster C - Perceptual inference mechanisms To study perceptual inference mechanisms we start from the functional level and ask how inferences concerning particular features such as colour, shape or motion are computed by neural populations. How these properties are encoded in the activity of single cells has been extensively studied in multiple brain areas, but it is still unclear how they are extracted and what computations among populations of neurons are necessary to do this. The central research questions are: Can we identify neural mechanisms for specific types of prior knowledge and its combination with the sensory input? How are different perceptual interpretations of an image represented and selected by the brain? By what mechanisms can population activity resolve ambiguities to arrive at unique percepts and actions? How are the responses of lower-level cells pooled to make higher-level inferences and predictions about the world? Cluster D - Information integration processes Higher-level perceptual inferences result from the combination of various kinds of information that may also originate from different sensory modalities. Here, we investigate the principles underlying the organization of higher-level neural representations and study how neural populations serve to integrate information from multiple sources. The central research questions are: Is prior knowledge encoded in an amodal or modality-specific fashion? What are the changes when moving from basic multi-modal cue integration tasks to spatial cognition or representation of numerosity? How is knowledge about priors acquired and generalised to novel conditions? What are the relevant time-scales for learning priors? How is information from sources with different reliability integrated? About us At the Bernstein Center Tübingen, scientists from various disciplines, including theoretical and experimental neurobiology, machine learning, and medicine, collaborate in order to analyze the basis of inference processes in the brain. In particular, a main research goal is to understand the coordinated interaction of neurons during information processing.

Impulses from the workforce, results from quality assurance measures and comparisons with others form the basis on which improvements are initiated. Knowledge and skills are exchanged and further developed in interdisciplinary, multi-professional teams and networks. For this purpose, methods and instruments from quality management are used professionally. This creates a lively culture of learning and togetherness.

The report also contains contact persons and contact addresses. Quality report UKT Quality report EchTAZ KTQ KTQ certificate Learn more KTQ certification KTQ certification focuses on the quality of processes, treatment and care outcomes, with the aim of identifying potential for improvement. A new review (recertification) by an external audit is required every three years. The University Hospital of Tübingen has been able to continuously optimize the quality of its services since the initial certification in 2009. This has enabled the hospital to better meet the needs of patients, their relatives, employees and visitors. Hygiene Maximum care houses require a full-time hospital hygienist. The hospital hygienist's task is to record and analyse any nosocomial (i.e. hospital-acquired) infections in cooperation with the hygiene specialists and the physicians in charge of hygiene in the clinic, to develop preventive measures, to translate them into practicable rules and to monitor their observance. He coordinates proactive measures to prevent and control antibiotic-resistant infectious agents in the clinic. As communication partner of the Public Health Service, he is in charge of the interface to the supervisory authorities and is also a member of the Hygiene Commission according to the Hospital Hygiene Ordinance Baden-Württemberg.

In order to guarantee the legal obligations as well as the claim of the University Hospital as a supraregional transplant centre, a Senior Transplantation Officer has been appointed by the Board of Directors of the Hospital, who is supported by other transplantation officers in the relevant clinical areas. The task of transplantation officers is to sensitize medical and nursing staff, patients and relatives as well as the public to the importance and urgent necessity of organ donation and to define and continuously optimize internal procedures for organ donation.

He also coordinates internal processes for fulfilling the reporting and cooperation obligations of users and operators of medical devices at the hospital. Frank Stegmaier, Dipl.-Ing.

In doing so, we emphatically accept our social responsibility and clearly commit ourselves to respecting human rights and the requirements of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. Declaration of Principles LkSG Compliance, Shareholdings and Internal Auditing staff unit Management: Tanja Jacob Compliance Officer Human Rights Officer E-mail address: Compliance@med.uni-tuebingen.de More about the staff unit The Whistleblower Protection Act requires companies to implement a whistleblower system for submitting reports. The Act regulates the protection of persons who have obtained information about violations in connection with their professional activities or in the run-up to professional activities and report these to the designated reporting bodies (whistleblowers). The Whistleblower Protection Act (HinSchG) grants whistleblowers protection against disadvantages that they could face as a result of reporting violations. Submitting a complaint Complaints under the LkSG and compliance notices (e.g., if there are indications of violations of laws as well as internal directives) can be reported online. You can choose whether you want to report anonymously or confidentially . Both are possible.

This includes cooperation at eye level in a patient-centred network of clinics, institutes and external partners. We offer our employees a wide range of development opportunities in a secure environment and optimally prepare our junior staff for their future careers in studies and training. We also keep a close eye on the social challenges of our time. Our Mission We care for our patients empathetically and competently at the highest medical level. We research and develop new innovative methods for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases in all medical fields. As a university hospital, we are particularly concerned with complex, serious and rare diseases. We shape medical care for the benefit of our patients with forward-looking teaching and training. Our vision From Tübingen, we are a driving force behind medical progress both nationally and internationally - close to the people. Our values People first The service to people drives us and is at the centre of our actions - whether on, for and with the patient, his relatives or ourselves. Always respectful and appreciative. Knowledge We create and convey knowledge and apply it. We make it available to others, even across borders. In doing so, we learn continuously, ask questions, question and educate ourselves further. Cooperation Our uniqueness and our added value lie in the synergy of patient care, research and teaching. We are one team. Dialogue is the bridge. This dialogue must be constantly conducted and maintained - interprofessionally and interdisciplinarily, across hierarchies. Set standards We set standards in research, teaching and patient care: This is our responsibility and our claim. We achieve this through innovative and sustainable action. In this way, we create an attractive environment for top-level medicine - both nationally and internationally. gegen-rechtsextremismus The University Hospital of Tübingen stands for high-quality patient care, research and teaching. It is also a matter of course for us that our actions for our patients are always based on equal treatment and fairness. Any form of discrimination, e.g. on the basis of ethnic origin, gender or religion, is deeply contrary to this self-image. For our 11,000 employees from over 120 nations, we want a workplace free of prejudice: we are committed to ensuring that they can treat, research and teach in an open-minded environment regardless of their origin, gender or sexual identity. Open-mindedness, tolerance and liberal democratic basic rights are cornerstones to which the University Hospital is expressly committed.

Der Ernährungszustand hat direkten Einfluss auf den Heilungsprozess, das körperliche Wohlbefinden sowie die Therapiefähigkeit. So kann eine adäquate und bedarfsdeckende Ernährung die Genesung und den Immunstatus positiv beeinflussen. Das Universitätsklinikum Tübingen spricht dem gesamten Ernährungsmanagement einen hohen Stellenwert zu und bündelt die Kompetenzen in einer eigenen Stabsstelle. Aufgabenbereiche Die Aufgabenbereiche umfassen Ernährungsberatung und -therapie gemäß dem aktuellen Stand der Wissenschaft (DGEM e.V. / ESPEN / DGE) Beratung, Schulung und Anleitung von Patienten und Patientinnen mit Ernährungssonden oder Stomaanlagen Implementierung therapeutischer Qualitätsstandards in fächerübergreifender Zusammenarbeit Sicherstellung einer bedarfsgerechten Weiterversorgung zu Hause oder im Pflegheim Prozessanalysen und -optimierungen im Bereich der Ernährungsmedizin Qualitätssicherung der Patientenverpflegung in Kooperation mit der Krankenhausküche Zusammengefasst ist die Stabsstelle Ernährungsmanagement klinikumsweiter Ansprechpartner rund um das Thema Ernährung sowie für die PEG- und Stomaversorgung.

Diese Möglichkeit ließen sich die beiden Studentinnen Cosima Naffin und Teresa Windschall der Medizinischen Fakultät der @unituebingen nicht entgehen. 🤝 Innerhalb einer Woche erhielten die beiden Medizin-Studentinnen die Chance, frische Landluft zu schnuppern und dabei unter anderem Einblicke in die hausärztliche Versorgung auf dem Land zu erhalten. 👨‍🔬 👩‍🔬 Im @landkreiscalw6764 sind, wie auch in vielen andere Landkreisen, die Hälfte aller ansässigen Ärzte und Ärztinnen um die 60 Jahre alt und gehen in den kommenden Jahren in den Ruhestand. Die Notwendigkeit der Gewinnung junger Nachwuchs-Ärzte und -Ärztinnen ist daher eindeutig. 👏 Zusammen mit dem Institut für Allgemeinmedizin und Interprofessionelle Versorgung ist die Medizinischen Fakultät der Universität Tübingen federführend an Konzeption und Umsetzung des Projektes für die Modellregion Calw beteiligt. Das Projekt ist bereits im Jahr 2021 gestartet und ist Anfang des Jahres um die zweite Modellregion Freudenstadt erweitert worden. 00:24 Interview Dr. med. Adrian Hettwer – Hausarzt in Calw 01:13 Was hält Teresa Windschall vom Projekt? 01:27 Georg Schwab - Patient: Einschätzung der Nachwuchskräfte 02:05 Prof. Dr. Stephan Zipfel – Prodekan für Lehre über das Modellprojekt 02:36 Kann sich Cosima Naffin vorstellen Ärztin auf dem Land zu werden? ➡ Interessierte Tübinger #Medizinstudierende können sich unter folgendem Link über das Wahlpflichtfach „Das volle Leben“ und das Modellprojekt informieren: https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/einrichtungen/institute/allgemeinmedizin/forschung/forschungsprojekte/modellregion-aerztliche-ausbildung Jun 18th at 9:51am RT @LabWalz: We are starting a phase-I #clinicaltrial for our #peptide #vaccine against acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Die beiden 22-Jährigen erzählen im Video von ihren Highlights aus den letzten vier Jahren. Die Vorteile des Studiengangs:  Im Laufe des Studiums erwerben die Studierenden pflegerisches und medizinisches Wissen, psychosoziale und pädagogische Kompetenzen und Organisationsfähigkeiten. Das steigert die Qualität in der Pflegepraxis.  Ein Pflegestudium fördert die Forschung im Bereich der Pflege und trägt zur Entwicklung innovativer Pflegekonzepte und -technologien bei.  In fast allen Ländern ist ein Studium der Pflege bereits fest etabliert. Durch die Einführung von Pflegestudiengängen wird Deutschland international wettbewerbsfähiger und kann von den Erfahrungen anderer Länder profitieren. 💰 Ein weiterer großer Vorteil: Nicht nur während des praktischen Teils, sondern während des gesamten Studiums gibt es Geld. Und: Absolventinnen und Absolventen mit Studienbeginn 2025 erhalten zusätzliche Kompetenzen, z.B. im Bereich Demenz, Diabetes und der Versorgung von chronischen Wunden. 📅📚👩‍⚕️ Du willst auch Pflege studieren? Der Einschreibungszeitraum für das Wintersemester beginnt am 30. Mai. Weitere Infos zum Studiengang und zur Bewerbung unter https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/pflegestudiengang und https://www.hs-esslingen.de/soziale-arbeit-bildung-und-pflege/studienangebote/bachelorstudiengaenge/pflege-bsc-und-berufszulassung/. Der Studiengang ist eine Kooperation zwischen der Hochschule Esslingen, der Medizinischen Fakultät der Universität und dem Universitätsklinikum Tübingen.

The social counselling or nursing transfers then sit down with our patients and, if desired, with their relatives to discuss and organise further care. Strong together! Sometimes patients need social counselling and also the transition of care. For example, if before the start of a rehab the patient can be discharged home - and help is needed there. No problem. We are a team and work closely together. Data protection Already at the time of admission to hospital, you will be asked for written consent to discharge management and the associated transfer of data, e.g. to nursing services. Strong together! Social counselling The social counselling service supports patients and their relatives with current personal and social problems related to their illness and the effects on their lives and those of their relatives. Learn more Care transition The nursing transition advises and supports patients and relatives when they go home after their stay in the clinic. It offers assistance in further care, for example by organizing an outpatient nursing service. Learn more Management Oliver Kutz Dipl.

In accordance with the DRG system, treatment costs are calculated according to the individual circumstances of the case. In the areas of psychiatry and psychosomatics, billing is predominantly based on flat-rate charges assessed using valuation ratios (flat-rate remuneration system for psychiatry and psychosomatics - PEPP). Co-payment by patients with statutory health insurance The University Hospital collects a co-payment from patients with statutory health insurance from the start of full inpatient hospital treatment - for a maximum of 28 days within a calendar year. The co-payment is currently 10 euros per calendar day. This amount is paid by the University Hospital to the corresponding member health insurance fund. Elective services Chefarztvertrag and comfort room Additional benefits and optional services While general hospital services such as accommodation, meals or medical care via the doctor on duty ensure medically appropriate and sufficient care for every patient in hospital, optional services go beyond the necessary care. These include optional services of medical and medical care (chief physician contract) or accommodation in a comfort ward or in a comfort room. Optional services can be used by privately insured persons, self-payers as well as persons with statutory health insurance. Please clarify with your health insurance company in good time before concluding a contract to what extent you are insured for the additional services. Legally binding information on clinic costs and tariff issues is provided exclusively by the administration of the University Hospital. Contractual general conditions Please inform yourself about the general terms and conditions of the University Hospital Tübingen. Contractual general conditions Enquiries If you have any queries about treatment costs or your statement, please contact the patient administration.

Many questions about the second competition phase have already been answered in our FA Q . If you have any further questions about the Clusters of Excellence funding line, please send them to our mailbox exzellenzcluster@dfg.d e . Funding Lines Based on the administrative agreement reached by the federal and state governments on 16 June 2016 and updated on 4 November 2022, the DFG and the German Council of Science and Humanities are implementing the Excellence Strategy in two funding lines: Clusters of Excellence (EXC) The Clusters of Excellence funding line is designed to support project-based funding in internationally competitive fields of research at universities or university consortia. The DFG is responsible for developing and implementing this funding line and for publishing calls for proposals every 7 years. Proposals are reviewed and decided on in an academically driven, competitive process. New initiatives go through a draft proposal and full proposal phase. In the first funding period (1 January 2019 to 31 December 2025) a total of 57 Clusters are being funded with an annual budget of 385 Mio. Euro. In the second funding period (1 January 2026 to 31 December 2032) up to 70 Clusters of Excellence can be funded with an annual budget of 539 Mio. Euro. Information on the Funding Line Cluster of Excellence (EXC ) Universities of Excellence (EXU) The Universities of Excellence funding line serves to strengthen universities as individual institutions or as university consortia in the long term and further develop their leading international role based on successful Clusters of Excellence. The German Council of Science and Humanities is responsible for developing and implementing this funding line. In the first funding period (2019 to 2026) ten Universities of Excellence and one University Consortium of Excellence are being funded with 148 Mio Euro annually. In the second funding period (2027 to 2033) up to four additional Universities or University Consortia of Excellence may receive funding. The next call for draft proposals for the second competition phase is expected to be issued in 2024. Information on the Funding Line Universities of Excellence (EXU ) Additional Programme Information Schedule for the Excellence Strategy On 29 – 30 November 2021, the Committee of Experts adopted an initial schedule for the second competition phase of the Excellence Strategy. Schedule as PDF downloa d Clusters of Excellence funding line: The second competition phase starts with the call for EXC draft proposal s on 15 December 2022. We ask that all new initiatives submit a letter of intent by 1 February 2023. For existing Clusters of Excellence planning a renewal proposal, it will, contrary to our previously communicated plans, not be necessary to submit letters of intent at such an early stage. The deadline for the submission of draft proposals for new Clusters of Excellence is 31 May 2023. Renewal proposals do not submit draft proposals. The review of the draft proposals will take place approximately between the end of August and mid-November 2023 and the final decision on the draft proposals for new Clusters of Excellence will be made on 1 February 2024. Only those initiatives invited by the Committee of Experts are eligible to submit a proposal. In advance of the proposal submission, we request an update on the letters of intent by 15 April 2024, so as to be able to incorporate any interim changes in the review schedule. Clusters of Excellence planning a renewal proposal are requested to submit a letter of intent by 29 January 2024. The submission deadline for all EXC proposals is 22 August 2024, with review of proposals scheduled from approximately early October 2024 to mid-February 2025. The funding decision on the future Clusters of Excellence will be made on 22 May 2025. The DFG guidelines serve as baseline standards for all reviews in the context of the Clusters of Excellence funding line. Guidelines for Avoiding Conflicts of Interes t Universities of Excellence funding line: The new call for proposals under the Universities of Excellence funding line is expected to start at the end of March 2024. Based on the decisions regarding the Clusters of Excellence in May 2025, new proposals will have to be submitted by mid-November the same year. From April to June 2026, site visits will take place in order to enable the Excellence Commission to arrive at decisions on four new projects in the programme line at the end of September 2026. The evaluation of the ten funded Universities of Excellence and the Excellence Network will begin with the submission of self-evaluation reports in August 2025. Site visits will take place from October to December the same year; in March 2026, the Committee of Experts will assess the results of the individual evaluations and submit their recommendation to the Excellence Commission accordingly. Further information on the Excellence Universities funding line can be found on the German Council of Science and Humanities websit e . Decision-Making Bodies Decisions on draft proposals and full proposals in the Excellence Strategy are made by the Committee of Experts and the Excellence Commission, respectively . The Committee of Experts consists of 39 members with proven research track records who represent the entire range of academic disciplines. In addition, they have extensive experience in international settings, in university management, in teaching or in the private sector. The Chair of the German Council of Science and Humanities and the President of the DFG are non-voting members of the committee and preside over it. The tasks of the Committee of Experts include defining the funding criteria, evaluating the draft and full proposals on the basis of peer reviews, making funding recommendations to the Excellence Commission, deciding on the draft proposals that qualify for submission of a full proposal, and assessing the results of the evaluation of the Universities of Excellence. The Excellence Commission consists of the Committee of Experts and the government ministers responsible for research at the federal and state levels. The Excellence Commission decides on the funding of Clusters of Excellence and Universities of Excellence on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee of Experts..

Was gibt der Region ihr Gesicht? Ist es das, was man in den Hochglanzbroschüren der Tourismusindustrie lesen kann, oder vielleicht doch etwas anderes? Da Künstlerinnen und Künstler von Natur aus der eigenen Kultur sowie fremden Kulturen ganz allgemein mit der Distanz des Forschenden begegnen, sind sie interessante Dialogpartner für derartige Fragen. Seismographisch reagieren sie mit dem Blick des Fremden auf die spezifisch, sinnlichen Qualitäten ihrer Umgebung und materialisieren ihre formalen, sozialen, politischen historischen Beobachtungen und Erfahrungen in ihren künstlerischen Werken. Unter dem Format Außer Haus erweitert die Kunsthalle Tübingen ihre Aktivitäten in den Stadtraum und schlägt Brücken zu den Bewohnern. Als Reisende im Körper der Stadt werden Künstlerinnen und Künstler eingeladen, die Stadt Tübingen zu besuchen und ortspezifisch, auf den sozialen und kulturellen Raum mit Projekten zu reagieren.

Roswita Hietel-Weniger und Dr. Nicole Fritz Kunsthallen heute sind wichtige Resonanzräume, in denen wir Kunst nicht nur kognitiv rational wahrnehmen, sondern vor allem auch unsere sinnliche Wahrnehmung schärfen können. Nach einer kunsthistorischen Hinführung ins Thema durch Nicole Fritz lädt Roswita Hietel-Weniger Sie zu einer von ihr angeleiteten Meditation ein. Bei dieser entwickeln Sie, ausgehend von den Werken, ein Gespür für Ihr eigenes bildhaftes Denken. Auf diese Weise kommen Sie möglicherweise auf Gedanken, die Sie noch nie hatten und lernen Menschen und Orte kennen, an denen Sie noch nicht waren. Fangen Sie an, Kunst mit uns neu zu erleben. more Teilnahmegebühr: 15 € / Person Teilnehmendenzahl begrenzt Nach Voranmeldung info@kunsthalle-tuebingen.de oder telefonisch von Montag–Freitag (vormittags 9–12 Uhr) unter +49 (0)7071 9691 12.

It is part of the traditional Tübingen University Hospital, which is located only 20 minutes by car from Stuttgart airport. Professor Tatagiba and his young and specialized team offer the whole range of treatment methods in neurosurgery. Our goals are to provide patient-oriented care, to study neurosurgical conditions and to develop new treatment techniques and modalities as well as to provide education and training for medical students and doctors. The difficult context of neurosurgical conditions requires treatment by specialized physicians. At our specialized out-patient clinics, you will find the right expert for your questions and problems. While we are continuously expanding, the number of neurosurgical interventions performed at our hospital each year has reached almost 3.000. This makes it one of the busiest neurosurgical departments in Germany. There are five operation rooms, soon to be equipped with intraoperative MRI (one of only a few devices in Europe), where surgical operations are carried out by an experienced team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses. Our dedicated and excellent neurosurgery intensive care team provides the best possible post-operative care at our own intensive care unit with 14 beds.For the benefit of our patients, we maintain intensive collaborations with neighboring disciplines such as anesthesiology; neuroradiology; neurology; ENT surgery; cardio-thoracic surgery, craniofacial surgery, ophthalmology, endocrinology, etc. More than 3000 Surgeries/Year 5 Operating rooms 87 Beds Our services are subjected to permanent quality control. We are certified according to KTQ (collaboration for transparency and quality in hospitals), Oncocert (German Cancer Society) and the German Soceity for Continence. And recently we were elected as the first post-graduate training center of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies.

It is part of the traditional Tübingen University Hospital, which is located only 20 minutes by car from Stuttgart airport. Professor Tatagiba and his young and specialized team offer the whole range of treatment methods in neurosurgery. Our goals are to provide patient-oriented care, to study neurosurgical conditions and to develop new treatment techniques and modalities as well as to provide education and training for medical students and doctors. The difficult context of neurosurgical conditions requires treatment by specialized physicians. At our specialized out-patient clinics, you will find the right expert for your questions and problems. While we are continuously expanding, the number of neurosurgical interventions performed at our hospital each year has reached almost 3.000. This makes it one of the busiest neurosurgical departments in Germany. There are five operation rooms, soon to be equipped with intraoperative MRI (one of only a few devices in Europe), where surgical operations are carried out by an experienced team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses. Our dedicated and excellent neurosurgery intensive care team provides the best possible post-operative care at our own intensive care unit with 14 beds.For the benefit of our patients, we maintain intensive collaborations with neighboring disciplines such as anesthesiology; neuroradiology; neurology; ENT surgery; cardio-thoracic surgery, craniofacial surgery, ophthalmology, endocrinology, etc. More than 3000 Surgeries/Year 5 Operating rooms 87 Beds Our services are subjected to permanent quality control. We are certified according to KTQ (collaboration for transparency and quality in hospitals), Oncocert (German Cancer Society) and the German Soceity for Continence. And recently we were elected as the first post-graduate training center of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies.

Along with bacteria which have a positive effect on human health, microbiomes contain potentially life-threatening pathogens. In the past, broad-spectrum antibiotics have often been used to tackle them. Nowadays it is known that this not only promotes resistance to antibiotics – in many cases it also damages the microbiome as a whole. CMFI researchers aim to develop new strategies to control microbial mechanisms and fight infections. The Cluster of Excellence CMFI brings together researchers from different disciplines such as infection biology, immunology, bioinformatics, pharmaceutical biology, antibiotics research, molecular and medical microbiology, biotechnology, environmental biology, systems biology, chemistry, and medical history and ethics. Their common goal is to elucidate the mechanisms of interaction between beneficial and harmful bacteria and the host in order to develop novel targeted therapeutic and anti-infective treatments. The CMFI is one of more than 50 Clusters of Excellence funded by German federal and state governments as part of the Excellence Strategy to sustainably strengthen Germany as a center of science, improve its international competitiveness and make cutting-edge research at German universities visible. In addition to the University of Tübingen, the Max Planck Institute for Biology and the University Hospital Tübingen are involved in the CMFI.

Privacy Policy & Change Settings Detailed Information Research Research Mission Microbial communities (“ microbiomes ”) that populate human body surfaces impact health in many critical, yet enigmatic ways: They contribute to vital body functions via complex metabolic and immunomodulatory activities but are, at the same time, major reservoirs for facultative pathogens that cause the majority of invasive bacterial infections. A worldwide increase in antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens (ARBPs), coupled with declining discoveries of novel classes of antibiotics, raises the specter of a post-antibiotic era. Preventing the spread, human colonization, and subsequent infection by ARBPs is essential in preserving fundamental medical achievements of the 20th century. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials in current use both damage microbiomes and promote rapid ARBP evolution. A paradigm shift in infection control is needed, putting a hold to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and enabling the development of targeted anti-infective strategies that promote microbiome integrity. Beneficial ‘commensal’ bacteria can limit the expansion of facultative pathogens in microbiomes but we are far from harnessing these mechanisms for therapeutic interventions. The researchers at the Cluster of Excellence "Controlling Microbes to Fight Infections" (CMFI) aim to elucidate the mechanisms of interaction between beneficial and harmful and the host in order to develop novel targeted therapeutic and anti-infective treatments. In four larger Research Areas and seven Junior Research Groups , the researchers work on joint projects in an interdisciplinary manner. The CMFI also funds the professorships "Bacterial Metabolomics" and "Microbiome-Host Interactions". Research Areas CMFI researchers come together in over 40 projects in four Research Areas (A, B, C, D). The Research Areas range from A: Bacterial Molecules & Cells to B: Bacterial Cells & Communities and C: Bacterial Communities & Host to D: Towards Integrative Therapy Concepts . More Junior Research Groups The Junior Research Groups are led by outstanding young scientists and complete the research strategy of the Cluster. The CMFI provides financial support and equips the laboratories with cutting-edge technology. More Professorships © Leon Kokkoliadis The professorships "Bacterial Metabolomics" and "Microbiome-Host Interactions" were established at the University of Tübingen. Researchers from the CMFI were appointed to these professorships.

Privacy Policy & Change Settings Detailed Information Research Areas The four research areas (A, B, C, D) work closely together to understand microbiome-host interactions. The research program maps increasingly complex interactions ranging from the molecular level (A) to the community level (B) to the microbiome-host level (C). Results from these areas are incorporated into translational integrative therapeutic approaches (D). In all four sections, the research is strongly interdisciplinary. It illuminates processes from different scientific perspectives and encourages original and synergistic collaborative research approaches. Bacterial Molecules and Cells Bacterial Cells and Communities Bacterial Communities and Host Towards Integrative Therapy Concepts Central questions: Which bacterial molecules govern the specific interactions of bacterial cells with other microorganisms and host cells? (A) Which complex interaction networks shape mutualism or antagonism along with strain evolution and adaptation in bacterial communities? (B) Which general principles are used by bacterial microbiome members and host cells to communicate and interfere with each other? (C) How can discoveries from the other areas be harnessed for innovative microbiome-based diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies?

Privacy Policy & Change Settings Detailed Information Junior Research Groups The Junior Research Groups are led by outstanding young scientists and complete the research strategy of the Cluster. The CMFI provides financial support and equips the laboratories with cutting-edge technology. Bastounis Lab © Efthimia Bastounis Host cells interact with bacterial pathogens in a milieu dominated not only by chemical but also mechanical signals, including those imposed on them by the extracellular environment or neighboring cells. The Bastounis Lab wants to reveal (i) how bacteria hijack host cellular forces to facilitate their spread, and (ii) which biomechanical strategies host cells use to obstruct bacterial dissemination. The lab intends to discover novel biomechanical virulence mechanisms and new aspects of host cell and tissue mechanobiology. More Baumdicker Lab © Franz Baumdicker The Baumdicker Lab combines mathematical population genetics theory, computational biology, and machine learning approaches to understand how the diversity of microbes emerged and how bacterial populations cooperate to adapt to their environment. Focus is on (i) understanding how the transfer of genetic material and the evolutionary dynamics of gene gain and loss influence the composition of bacterial pan-genomes; (ii) explaining the maintenance and spread of CRISPR-Cas systems in prokaryotic populations; (iii) improving the estimation and classification of bacterial genome evolution and human population history. More Molitor Lab © Marco-Linus Ernst, Christian Fink, Nils Rohbohm, University of Tübingen Methanogens are part of the human gut microbiome but very little is known on the interactions between methanogens and the rest of the microbiome. The Molitor Lab is interested in (i) mining new methanogen-specific viruses and (ii) studying the interaction of these viruses with their methanogenic hosts. The long term goal is to investigate the influence of methanogenic viruses within microbial communities and to deploy these viruses to modulate the composition of microbiomes. More Petras Lab © Daniel Petras Being able to identify a wide range of small molecules in complex environments provides us with thousands of compounds but little knowledge about their ecological relevance. Combining a unique expertise at the interface of natural product research, mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics and proteomics as well as chemical biology, the Petras Lab aims to determine the influence of small molecules on complex microbial communities and mine novel bioactive compounds. The long-term goal is to investigate the molecular function and the role of natural products in shaping the structure of microbial communities and the interaction of these assemblies with their hosts. More Ratzke Lab © Christoph Ratzke Microbes usually don’t live isolated but together with myriads of other microbes in large communities, in the environment as well as on and in our bodies. Despite their importance for human health, we have very limited understanding of the mechanisms that shape and govern these communities. The long term goal of the Ratzke lab is to understand how interactions between microbes can prevent microbial infections and how microbial communities could be modified and constructed for medical applications.

The Hector Fellow Academy accepted Brochado into its funding program and she was awarded the Research Career Development Award in 2020. In 2021 the University of Würzburg honored her for her research with the “Röntgen Prize”. In her work, Ana Rita Brochado explores the question of what influence the entire environment has on the effect of antibiotics. It has long been clear that it is not only the type and dosage of antibiotics that determine their effect on bacteria, but also other bacteria and substances. With her research group, Brochado combines different approaches from systems biology. Molecular biological analysis can provide clues as to how resistance to antibiotics can be outwitted by a combination of different active ingredients.

Special attention is given to Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and rare movement disorders such as ataxias. As a result, the Tübingen experts are studying nerve-damaging inflammatory processes in the brain as well as hereditary factors that can play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, as some gene variants can increase the risk of disease or even directly trigger a disease, while other variants protect against it. At the DZNE Tübingen, researchers therefore hope to discover such risk and protection factors in order to pave the way for new measures in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Our research aims to enable earlier diagnosis and better treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Prof. Thomas Gasser Site speaker (acting) at DZNE Tübingen Through human clinical observation and threapy studies, scientists at the DZNE in Tübingen are also working on a better method for early detection of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ataxias, and on new therapeutic measures. To this end, they are examining the research participants to find biomarkers, which are measurable biological indicators (in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid, for example) that can be used to detect a disease and assess how it will progress. Clinical research in Tübingen is also dedicated to the rare, hereditary form of Parkinson’s disease. Your commitment can make a big difference!

TÜBINGEN TÜBINGEN Admin Project Description YOUNG LIFE IN AN ANCIENT SETTING YOUNG LIFE IN AN ANCIENT SETTING Tübingen offers you the rare chance to experience an almost completely preserved Old Town of half-timbered houses. You get the best view of the colorful ensemble of historic facades walking along the idyllic Neckar island in the middle of the river: Overlooked by the “Stiftskirche” (Collegiate Church) at the “Holzmarkt” square, sights like the 16th-century “Alte Aula” (old university auditorium), the “Burse”, “Evangelisches Stift” (Protestant hall of residence and teaching) and “Schloss Hohentübingen” (Hohentübingen Castle) line up like pearls to form the picturesque “Neckarfront” (Neckar riverbank). It is romantically set in scene by the famous yellow “Hölderlinturm” (Hölderlin Tower), the town’s landmark. To enjoy this panorama from above, there is no better place than the tower of the Collegiate Church – the medieval rooftop landscape is a must-see vista! 1,000 years of city history await you under the roofs and behind the colorful facades. Famous poets and philosophers lived and studied in the “Hölderlinturm” and the “Evangelisches Stift”, while “Schloss Hohentübingen” today houses the university – the heart and soul of Tübingen. Since it was founded in 1477, brilliant minds, ingenious scientific achievements like the discovery of DNA, and nine Nobel Prize winners have been an integral part of the city. In cosmopolitan Tübingen, student lifestyle meets tradition. Intellect and fun go hand in hand, around the market square with its imposing town hall, for example. Here you can amble around the little boutiques and unique shops, enjoy a smoothie in the student café, or traditional Swabian cuisine in a wine tavern: cheese spaetzle (noodles), lentils, Swabian ravioli and a roast are always on the menu. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays the farmers’ market entices you to browse and shop at the stalls. On warm summer evenings, the market square is a popular hangout with a Mediterranean flair. From the market, you pass by antique shops into the winding alleyways of the romantic vineyard quarter, known to many locals as the “Gôgenviertel”. Not to be missed are the sensational UNESCO World Heritage ice age figures in the “Museum Alte Kulturen” (Museum of Ancient Cultures) at “Schloss Hohentübingen”. Just outside the town center, the Cistercian monastery of “Bebenhausen”, founded in the 12th century, beckons with its Blue Hall and Green Hall, a beautiful cloister, and an elegant refectory. After all these discoveries on land, you should be sure to take to the water, too: no visit to Tübingen is complete without a leisurely trip along the colourful “Neckarfront” riverbank on a punting boat.

For the people of Tübingen, tolerance is a matter of great importance. The town also has an environment-friendly image and most people here are nature lovers. You’ll notice this as soon as you arrive at the station: there are bicycles everywhere. The town wants to avoid too much traffic and polluted air. Tübingen’s Christmas market is also rather special. In the winter, there’s an open-air cinema where local residents and students traditionally watch the cult German film „Feuerzangenbowle“ together. It’s also traditional to drink a mug of „Feuerzangenbowle“, rum punch, which the film is named after. Winter wouldn’t be winter in Germany without a „Feuerzangenbowle“! Cafés, restaurants, shops and student bars abound in Tübingen. You can party at lots of bars in Tübingen, especially on a Saturday night. A pub crawl, or „Kneipentour“, is a typical way of spending an evening at the weekend. You can go from bar to bar and enjoy a beer or long drink. A pub crawl usually ends in one of the bars or small dance clubs.

Thanks in advance for your continued support! 1.7K shares With the allure of a chocolate festival, I made my way to the southern Germany town of Tübingen (also known as Tuebingen or Tubingen to English speakers). While this town was named one of Germany’s most photogenic towns, it holds a special place in my heart for an entirely different reason – it’s where I studied abroad 6 years ago! Tübingen was actually home to the first “Beer Time With Wagner” blog when I was still on the WordPress free platform. Even though the blog initially died out after a month, it made a reappearance in 2013 and the name stuck until I rebranded a year ago. It was wonderful to finally be back in Tübingen in wintertime – filled with lots of yummy cafes, snowy side streets, and a sense of coziness. Table of Contents How to get to Tübingen As a university town, Tübingen might be quaint but it is still easily accessible! The simplest way to reach the town is by car. However, there are still many other transportation options: Train Most trains arriving and departing from Tübingen are regional trains. Thus, you’ll most likely be switching from a high speed train in Stuttgart (the closest big city) to a regional train from Stuttgart to Tübingen. However, these trains are quite efficient and run on a regular schedule. Plane The closet airport to Tübingen is the Stuttgart Airport. Thankfully, the airport is well-connected to many European destinations. They also have one long-haul flight from Atlanta. Once you land in Stuttgart, you can easily take a train, bus, or car directly to Tübingen. Bus The most direct way to Tübingen is via a bus. There are local buses and long-distance buses that will take you to the town center. The local buses run within the region of Stuttgart and can connect you directly from Stuttgart’s city center as well as the airport to Tübingen. The long-distance buses connect Tübingen with many cities and towns both within, and outside of, Germany. History of Tübingen As students make up one-third of Tübingen’s population, the history of the town is very much integrated into the university’s history. The university is one of the oldest in all of Europe – it was founded in 1477 and is considered one of the five classical universities of Germany (along with Heidelberg – where I did my master’s degree). The city is especially known for its Germanic studies program, theology program, law school, and science programs (including medicine). DNA was actually discovered at the University of Tübingen in 1868. During the Third Reich, the University of Tübingen was unfortunately at the forefront of legitimizing Nazi beliefs and programs. The university employed very few Jews even before 1933 and any Jews still working at the university were forced into early retirement. Additionally, almost 1,200 sterilizations were performed at the University of Tübingen’s hospital. On a lighter note, the university has an impressive alumni roster. Famous students and professors include Johannes Kepler, Horst Köhler (President of Germany), Friedrich Hölderlin, Pope Benedict XVI, Friedrich Shelling, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel as well as 12 Nobel Laureates. Chocolate Festival in Tübingen I never had the opportunity to see Tübingen in wintertime and had eagerly been waiting to attend the annual international chocolate festival ! To be honest, the festival was a bit of a disappointment. However, how much of a disappointment could it actually be with so much chocolate everywhere?! I thought the festival would be a bit more interactive. Instead, it was mainly just stalls with different chocolate companies selling their goods. However, I’m never one to turn down chocolate 😉 Let’s be honest though, I took fullllll advantage of the mulled wine with chocolate in it. It was absolutely freezing and what’s better than chocolate warming you up? Mulled wine, that’s what’s better 😉 Double winning with chocolate and mulled wine together 😉 Also, I attended the festival with my friend Christina (she’s a fellow blogger over at Happy To Wander and her photos/blog are to die for…). We had never met in person prior to meeting at the festival so it was either going to be really awesome or really awkward. Thank goodness it was the former – I felt like we had been friends for years and it was great to swap blogging/traveling/Germany stories with her! Snowy Weather in Tübingen More exciting than the chocolate festival itself was waking up Sunday morning to the city blanketed in fresh, powdery snow. I can’t speak for southern Germany but Hamburg has had an unusually snowy winter! Maybe I’m a crazy person but I much prefer cold weather over hot weather any day of the week – bonus points if snow accompanies the cold weather. I felt like I was in a winter wonderland snow globe! Where to Eat & Drink in Tübingen Tübingen actually has an impressive food and cafe culture. Obviously, it’s nice to take advantage of all the cafes during summertime when they have outdoor seating but there are still plenty of opportunities for a good drink and a good meal in wintertime. Here are some of my favorites! Gasthaus Bären | Schmiedtorstraße 3 This restaurant serves the most delicious Swabian food for an absolute steal. Christina and I happened upon this restaurant and it was full of locals. The tables are close together and the noise level is quite high, but you can’t help but absolutely love it! We went for lunch and thought it was perfect. Zum Alten Fritz | Gartenstraße 13 We were both craving Italian food and stumbled across this restaurant as one of the top Italian recommendations. The interior makes you feel like you’re underground in a cave and the food is equally delicious. Also, not a bad selection of wine at all 😉 Cafe Tangente Jour | Münzgasse 17 While studying abroad in Tübingen, I must have come to this cafe at least once a week for their delicious tomato soup. The cafe is in a great location and the food was always so light and fresh! Collegium | Lange G. 8 Another really great cafe in the middle of town that serves reasonably priced food, beer, coffee, and everything in between! Piccolo Sole d’Oro | Metzgergasse 39 Definitely one of the best places in Tübingen for beer, wine, cocktails, coffee, and small snacks. The interior is cozy and authentic, and it is definitely one of the most popular spots to hang out for a drink (whether a mid-afternoon coffee, evening glass of wine, or weekend beer). Tübinger Wurstküche | Am Lustnauer Tor 8 This is the “it” place to go in Tübingen for traditional German/Swabian food! The menu is long and authentic, and the interior is just what you would imagine a German restaurant looking like inside. Liquid Bar / Die Kelter | Schmiedtorstraße 17 I found this restaurant/bar/lounge right at the end of my study abroad in Tübingen and I was kicking myself for not finding it sooner! While you can eat here, I came for the cocktails which are top-notch and highly recommended. Things To Do in Tübingen in Wintertime Market Square and City Hall (Marktplatz and Rathaus) The majestic Tübingen City Hall was built in the mid-15th century as a three-level building (the fourth level was added about 75 years later). The astronomical clock at the top of the building was installed in 1511 and still functions – showing the various locations of stars and the phases of the moon. While the Tübingen Market Square is taken full advantage of during the summer months (outdoor cafes and restaurants dot the entire Market Square), the winter months still add a level of charm, especially when snowing. Not only can you enjoy the Tübingen Chocolate Festival but weekly events and markets occur here year-round. Hohentübingen Castle (Schloss Hohentübingen) The most defining feature in Tübingen, Hohentübingen Castle rises high above the old town area of the city. The castle was first mentioned almost 1,000 years ago. While it has undergone multiple renovations and reconstructions, most of the modern-day castle is from the 1600s, reflecting the Renaissance style of the time period. Besides being a local tourist attraction, the castle is also home to numerous University of Tübingen institutions and collections as well as a museum. Regardless of the weather, Hohentübingen Castle provides great views of the entire city of Tübingen. Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church) The Collegiate Church is not just one of the main features in Tübingen but also has an important place in Reformation history. Built in 1470, it was one of the first churches to convert to Protestantism after Martin Luther’s Reformation. Interestingly enough, the church still has several Catholic features including patron saints and a shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Regardless of the weather, this church is open year-round and a nice place to hide away on a cold, snowy day! Hölderlin’s Tower and Ederhard’s Bridge (Hölderlinturm and Ederhardsbrücke) The postcard photo of Tübingen, Eberhard’s Bridge provides the iconic view of Tübingen. Regardless of the time of year, this view is absolutely stunning – between the falling snow in winter and the Stockerkahn (similar to punting) races in the summertime. As this bridge is directly between the main train/bus station and the old town of Tübingen, it’s impossible to miss it! Located at one end of these beautiful, colorful houses is Hölderlin’s Tower. He lived there from 1807 to his death in 1843. Diagnosed with schizophrenia and having had a mental breakdown, he was taken in by Ernst Zimmer, a carpenter that owned the tower and was enamoured with Hölderlin’s writing. Hölderlin spent the rest of his life living and working on the first floor of this tower. Neckar Island (Neckarinsel) A beautiful spot for a short walk along the river, Neckar Island is a small piece of tranquility located right in Tübingen. While I was visiting, the entire island was covered in snow, making my walk feel like a winter wonderland. It also gives a wonderful view of all the colorful houses lining the bank of the Neckar. In the summertime, people gather on the island to sunbathe or watch the local Stockerkahn boat races. Old Town Tübingen (Altstadt Tübingen) While quite small and doable in a day (or even an afternoon), the old town area of Tübingen is not to be missed! Some of my favorite streets include Burgsteige (leading up to the castle), Judengasse (the former Jewish quarter during the Middle Ages), Lange Gasse, and Münzgasse. Make sure to also explore and visit the university’s original buildings interspersed throughout the old town area. Final Thoughts on Tübingen in Wintertime I can’t believe it took me so long to visit Tübingen in wintertime – why didn’t I do this sooner?! While I have so many wonderful and fond memories of Tübingen in the summer months, there really is something magical and fairy tale-like about the snowy, wintery months of southern Germany. I feel like there are many more (snowy) adventures like this to come! 🙂 Share the Love!

I bet you absolutely loved living there during school! I think it is definitely made even more storybook-like by the snow. I wish I could have been on this trip with you! Vanessa Brune 6 years ago Reply I’ve seen pictures of Tübingen in the summer before but it looks like winter is really is the best time to visit! Those buildings and alleyways look absolutely gorgeous covered in snow! Can’t believe I’ve never been to the city… Kris 6 years ago Reply A chocolate festival certainly would’ve lured me back too. Then I would’ve stayed for the charming winter views with those snow-covered buildings. Would you recommend Tubingen as a day trip for visitors in southern Germany? Caroline L 6 years ago Reply Mulled wine with chocolate, yum!! Jordan, these photos are beautiful – I love that ‘postcard’ one & think you should frame it 🙂 Marya 6 years ago Reply the photos look so picturesque, almost like love actually-ish. 😉 it’s too bad that the chocolate festival was rather disappointing for you, as i actually expected something more when you mentioned it. but the mulled wine sounds like something that i have to try as i’ve never tasted it before. 😀 Lena 6 years ago Reply This city is so charming! I am still sometimes surprised how big countries like Germany can have so many faces to them. I’ve just recently visited Berlin and Bremen and they look completely different from Tubingen. Which just proves the point that you cannot say you know the country by simply visiting one city. Rosie 6 years ago Reply I always find that university towns have the best little cafes and bars, sounds like Tuebingen keeps up this tradition. I’m not sure I’d make it into any bars though if they are serving mulled wine with chocolate outside….mmmm gluhwein! The whole town looks picture perfect in the snow. I love the row of colourful houses muted by the white flakes. Lyne 6 years ago Reply The city is so lovely and colourful, it looks straight out of a tale with the snow! The clock tower is beautiful, I love this kind of clock that also tells about the phases of the moon and such! Sharon 6 years ago Reply The photos of this colorful, charming town with snow swirling all about — just stunning. I have missed this part of Germany so far. Pinned your post for future travel inspiration! Candice 6 years ago Reply It looks like a scene out of a fairytale! I really love the colour palette of the building there and a chocolate festival?! I didn’t even know those existed!! 🙂 Maggie 6 years ago Reply What a beautiful little town! This is a great, comprehensive guide to the city. And I’d be right there with you with the mulled wine with chocolate ?? Tami 6 years ago Reply Tubingen reminds me a lot of Rothenburg and also a little of Quebec City! All three are beautiful in the winter! I’m not really one to enjoy being cold, however, but I imagine that if I bundled up warm enough I would love strolling these medieval streets, the castle, and the plaza. The chocolate festival would also be a fun event. Are there Christmas markets here as well? Maybe that would be the best time to visit! Lindsey Mitchell 6 years ago Reply Always looking for more winter posts! Especially with festivals!! Appreciate the inclusion of how to get there tips. Brigitte 6 years ago Reply Damn its so pretty up there! I really love the content and the edit of your photos. Keep up the good work!

I saw these photos and stumbled on the article. I have been to Germany before, but these markets especially the chocolate market : wow Haylee 6 years ago Reply Oh my gosh! Your photos are just MAGICAL!! I can see why it was named one of Germany’s most photogenic towns. I’d love to see more of Germany too, think I’ll be putting this town on my list! Carmelatte 6 years ago Reply Magiacal, simply magical <3 it has got such a Tolkien-like vibe! http://carmelatte.co/floral-cafe-london/ Anna 6 years ago Reply Wow! This town looks so cute. It must have been so nice to rediscover it after all those years. However, rather unfortunate about the chocolate festival. But, I think I would still check out the festival. i’m glad to be prepared for what it is actually like though. Bruna Bersch 6 years ago Reply What a charming and beautiful town! The winter really makes the scenario looking like it came out from a fairy tale! Thanks for sharing your experience and these beautiful pictures! Makes me want to go there!! Sarah 6 years ago Reply Ohh Jordan this is bringing back such fond memories of my time in Germany this past Christmas market season! And I have to say I’m with you on the mulled wine 😉 Camila @ Adventitious Violet 6 years ago Reply Your snowy photos are so beautiful!

Leibniz Association >​ Research >​ Leibniz ScienceCampi Geogenomic Archaeology Campus Tübingen (GACT) – Leibniz ScienceCampus Tübingen Caves provided early humans with easily accessible living space and protection from rain, wind and cold. But numerous species - from microbes to large mammals - also found shelter here. Caves were probably the first ecosystems to be profoundly altered by human activity. The Leibniz ScienceCampus "Geogenomic Archaeology Campus Tübingen (GACT)" investigates the interaction of humans with cave ecosystem from the Pleistocene to the present day. Archaeological and palaeoecological studies have shown that even ancient hunter-gatherer groups played a substantial role in the global distribution of species and in the shaping and management of their environments. GACT brings together archaeologists, geneticists, microbiologists, geochemists, geoecologists, paleontologists, and paleoclimatologists, among others, with the ultimate goal of using ancient DNA recovered from cave deposits to investigate human interaction with, and impact on, past ecosystems through time. In order to achieve this goal, GACT will establish new molecular, computational, geochemical and geoarchaeological methods to analyze sedimentary sequences recovered from the investigated caves. The topic is also attracting general interest among non-scientists, as climate change and biodiversity loss are currently the subject of increasing public debate.

Only an hour by train from Stuttgart, Tubingen offers one of the oldest universities in Germany, a lot of half-timbered houses, and a picturesque old town with many cafes and bars. Image by Th G from Pixabay This city is situated in the Baden-Wurttemberg Region. There are so many places to visit in Tubingen Germany. Incidentally, a total of 30% of the 91,000 inhabitants are students, which means that Tubingen has a particularly lively flair and I like it very much. It has almost 90,000 inhabitants and more than 230,000 visitors come to the city on the Neckar every year – but it is still an insider tip. For more similar articles check Brandenburg Region . Let’s discover together places to visit in Tubingen Germany. 1. Old auditorium Tubingen Source: Instagram The old auditorium in the immediate vicinity of the collegiate church is one of the first buildings after the founding of the university. The five-story building is entered from the Münzgasse. You are immediately on the third floor, as the old auditorium is built on a steep southern slope. The “Universitätshaus” originally called the “Aula nova” building was built in 1547 in place of the “Sapienza” that had burned down a few years earlier. Grain stocks were stored in the attic of what was originally a pointed-gable half-timbered house as part of the professor’s salary. 2. Old Botanical Garden in Tubingen Source: Instagram In 1805 the site was set up as the university’s botanical garden with an arboretum, greenhouses, and a palm house. In the 17th century, the place was still used as a training ground for the students of the “Collegium illustre”; at times there was a riding school and a theater here. In 1969 the Botanical Garden moved to the Morgenstelle near the newly established Natural Science Institute. It is considered one of the places to visit in Tubingen Germany. 3. Hohentubingen Castle Museum Source: Instagram Hohentubingen Castle is home to the Ancient Cultures Collection. Its highlights include the mammoth, the wild horse, the Tubingen gun runner, and an Egyptian burial chamber. The collections belong to the Museum of the University of Tubingen and provide exciting insights into the history of human culture. There are around 4,600 exhibits on 2,000 square meters, including the oldest works of art known to mankind (UNESCO World Heritage Site Ice Age Art). 4. Tubingen Town Hall Source: Instagram The Tubingen town hall was built in 1435 and expanded and renovated in several phases. From about 1471 to 1805 it served as the seat of the Court of Justice of the State of Württemberg. In addition to images of justice, friezes and sgraffito paintings, the facade contains an astronomical clock. 5. Collegiate Church (Selected as one of the best places to visit Tubingen Germany) Source: Instagram The Collegiate Church in Tubingen is already a landmark of the university town due to its architectural presence. Those who climb the 170 steps to the top of the tower will be rewarded with a magnificent view of the Neckar and Ammer valleys. Regular concerts. Note it as one of the places to visit in Tubingen Germany. 6. Burse Source: Instagram Anyone who stands in front of the mighty, pink-painted half-timbered building from the 15th century will immediately sense that this is an important historic site in Tubingen. The building, which has housed the philosophical seminar and the art history institute of the university since 1971, has had dazzling names and changing functions. 7. Cotta house Tubingen Source: Instagram The Cotta’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, founded in 1659 in the Münzgasse, wrote a history of more than 150 years in Tubingen. From 1787 to 1810, however, it was Johann Friedrich von Cotta who brought it to great success with a great deal of publishing skill and a great deal of personal contact with his authors. The small sign on the side building of the Cotta house is almost as famous as the Cotta house itself. 8. Neckar Island Tubingen Source: Instagram The Neckarinsel is an almost 1km long island in the Neckar, which was created by branching off a parallel canal to regulate the water level. It extends from the headland west of the Ammertalbahn bridge to the Neckar bridge. 9. Marienkirche Source: Instagram In the middle of the city is the Marienkirche, which gives the parish its name – and which is the landmark of our town. The Marienkirche was built in 1247-1343 by the citizenry. In 1988 it was declared a National Cultural Monument. In the Reformation Church, visitors will find a late Gothic holy grave and a legendary octagonal baptismal font (15th century). 10. Holderlin Tower Tubingen Image by sulox32 from Pixabay And another landmark of Tubingen, right on the idyllic Neckarfront. The German poet Friedrich Hölderlin resided in the yellow tower for 36 years. The building has been renovated since 2017 and will reopen in early 2020 with a new exhibition. It is listed as one of the best places to visit in Tubingen.

The home of poet Hölderlin, however, has long found a way to strike a peaceful balance between the traditional chimes of the Town Hall's carillon and the raucous guitars in the clubs. More than 900 years of history lie at your feet in Tübingen's Old Town. Steep steps, narrow lanes and pointed gabled houses dominate the townscape all the way up to the castle. There is always something going on in Tübingen, and not just in the lovingly restored town centre, which is hardly surprising given the 28,500 students who live here. The town's charming shops, bars and restaurants make it the perfect place to hang out or go for a stroll. Built in 1435, the Town Hall on the Marktplatz square was adorned with an ornate astronomical clock in 1511 that is still operational today. The annual punt race around the Neckar River island guarantees plenty of riotous entertainment in Tübingen's events calendar. The waterfront, which features Hölderlin Tower – one of the town's most famous landmarks and most photographed spots – is close by.

And that the finds and the caves have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site? The collections held by the Tübingen Kunsthalle art gallery are also internationally renowned, while the local theatres and festivals all shape the town's vibrant cultural scene. After all, if there's one thing that the locals, students, wine growers and professors do agree on, it's that culture is fun and puts people in a good mood. But it's best to see for yourself.

Justin and I only had 24 hours to spend in Tübingen and we made the most of every moment. There are so many unique things to do in Tubingen, and you can see a lot in just a short amount of time. You can walk everywhere within its historic old town, exploring on foot. While this isn’t a guide for absolutely everything to do in Tubingen, we covered a lot of ground in one day. If you only have one day in Tubingen, this travel guide is for you. WHY T ÜBINGEN? You might not have heard of Tübingen, but put this town on your travel radar. When I was researching our trip to Germany , Switzerland , and France , I wanted to visit a small town in western Germany, somewhere between Zurich and Frankfurt . Justin and I are finding more and more than we’re drawn to these smaller, captivating towns. Maybe it’s because I am from a small town myself. After some searching, I stumbled upon some photos of Tübingen and knew that we had to visit. About 30km south of Stuttgart, it was right on our route and I couldn’t resist the photos of its brightly painted, half-timbered houses. This article contains affiliate links, which help run this site at no extra cost to you. We have records of the town from as early as 1078, although Germanic tribes populated the area back in the 6th and 7th centuries. While wandering its photogenic, cobblestone streets, you’ll see that Tübingen is remarkably well preserved. During World War II, Tübingen was largely spared due to the lack of industry, high concentration of hospitals and the peace initiative of a local doctor. Tübingen is a traditional university town; about one in three people living there is a student. From its historical sites to its beautiful green spaces, there are so many unique things to do in Tubingen. Here are some of the activities we enjoyed in the town, and you’ll be able to easily do everything on this list within 24 hours of staying here. ROAM THE OLD TOWN A great way to get acquainted with a brand new place is to take a guided walking tour with a local resident. We were grateful to take a walking tour all over Tübingen upon our arrival, from the base of old town right up to the castle grounds. Justin and I learned lots of interesting facts about Tübingen with details straight from a guide who has lived in the town all her life. After the walking tour, we continued to explore on our own in more depth. In mid-June, the town itself wasn’t incredibly busy and certainly wasn’t swarming with tourists. We really enjoyed the youthful vibes of the town, highly populated with university students. Wander at your own pace around every narrow alleyway, between the crooked half-timbered homes. You’ll notice old architecture and picturesque churches. Bursts of bright, beautiful flowers lined the river and were flourishing from planters all over town. Everywhere you look appears as if from a postcard. GO PUNTING ON THE NECKAR RIVER A punting trip is a bucket list activity that you simply must do when you’re in Tübingen. Punting (known as Stocherkahn) is a university tradition and most boats are owned by student fraternities. The boats are long and flat with bench seating in rows. The punter propels the boat forward by pushing a pole against the bottom of the riverbed. Although we missed it this year, there’s an annual race every June between the students called the Stocherkahnrennen . Approximately 40 teams race in punts around the Neckar island in a lighthearted and fun event. As you can imagine, the river gets quite crowded with boats, especially in the narrower sections. The winning team throws a party, and the losing team members must drink a glass of cod liver oil, as well as organize the next year’s event. Both public and private punting trips are available. Justin and I embarked on a private punting trip on the morning before our departure. Our guide was amazing and very skilled in navigating our punt around the river. At one point, we even got to try it out for ourselves. It’s not as easy as it looks! The ride took about one hour, and it was incredibly scenic. We drifted past the green island in the middle and many colourful homes. Lots of ducks paddled right up to our boat, curious about our adventure on the water. I highly recommend you book a punting trip if you have the opportunity. There are even special events like wine tastings on the punt, and gourmet meals served on board. It’s very common to take a barbecue out on the river aboard the punts. EXPLORE THE CASTLE WITH A VIEW The Renaissance complex of Hohentübingen Castle is high on the hill, overlooking the old town. Walk up a steep, cobblestone road to reach the castle property. While the castle was built in 1037, it was extended in the 16th century, resulting in a mix of architectural styles. The castle is home to the university and some museums, including the Ancient Culture Museum. There are artifacts dating back 40,000 years, including some of the oldest artworks ever known to be produced by humans. Small figures carved out of mammoth tusks and bones were discovered inside caves in Germany, and they’re now recognized by UNESCO for their historical importance. You can see these on display at the Ancient Culture Museum. A large DNA sculpture in the castle’s square pays tribute to Friedrich Miescher who discovered DNA in 1869. From Hohentübingen Castle, soak up some of the best panoramic views of Tübingen from the castle grounds. You can see all sides of the city, including the old town and the Neckar River. Wander around the property and gaze out above and beyond hundreds of red rooftops. BROWSE MARKET SQUARE The heart of Tübingen is the Marktplatz, or Market Square. The Rathaus (City Hall) serves as the focal point, and it is an intricately painted building with a functioning astronomical clock at the top. The facade was painted in 1877 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the university. Take a break here from walking or stop for a cup of coffee. Admire Neptune’s Fountain, created by Heinrich Schickhard in the 17th century. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings, be sure to check out the local farmer’s market for fresh produce and beautiful fresh flowers. We wandered through Market Square on numerous occasions and it was always bustling with people, whether it was students in the evening or patrons at the market in the morning. Browsing a market with the dramatic backdrop of city hall is certainly one of many unique things to do in Tubingen. STROLL THE NECKARINSEL The park, Neckarinsel, forms an island in the Neckar River in the middle of Tübingen. The Platanenallee is an avenue of 200 year old planar trees. Walk between the row of ancient trees that extend up to the sky. It’s one of the most scenic river walks along a distinct waterfront, bordered by colourful houses on the city wall. At the entrance to the Neckarinsel, there’s a large birdhouse for pigeons that was rather cute. However, it’s more functional than just a home for pigeons. When the pigeons that live here lay their eggs, city workers replace their eggs with plaster ones in efforts to take control over the pigeon population. WANDER THE BOTANICAL GARDEN Another peaceful place in Tübingen is the botanical garden. It’s a large, public park, where you can sit and admire the flora or simply meander about. Many people ride their bikes through here or relax on park benches. I found many flowerbeds and even a tree that was more than 250 years old. If I lived in Tubingen, I would love to spend more time here. I can see how it would be the perfect place to read a book as a university student. Spending peaceful moments in nature is one of my favourite things to do in Tubingen. STUMBLE UPON PUBLIC ART I wasn’t expecting to find any street art in Tübingen, but I should have known better. Tübingen is a youthful, mostly liberal town that focuses on artistic endeavors. There are some small statues and sculptures, dedicated to things like reading and cycling. The Radfahrerkönig, also known as the Cycling King, is a small statue in a square that pays tribute to a favourite pasttime in Tubingen, which is bike riding. I also found another sculpture of a book, as well as some other art on walls and doors. There’s likely even more around town – you just need to wander around to discover it! While this isn’t a work of art, it is a beautiful structure that may as well be. This is Tubingen’s CityTree, designed to improve air quality in an eco-friendly manner. This extra splash of greenery also adds an interesting and wonderful design element to an otherwise ordinary city street. SHOP AT SPECIALTY STORES There are many specialty shops and boutiques to get a dose of retail therapy in Tübingen. While it might not seem like one of the top things to do in Tubingen, there are many unique, independently owned shops in town. Der Kartoffelladen sells knives and potatoes, an interesting combination. At Speicher, you’ll find groceries and food from around the world, as well as a focus on bulk foods without any packaging. At Alnatura Super Natur Markt, there were lots of organic and specialty foods, including lots of vegan items like chocolate and ice cream bars. In addition, there are lots of quaint coffee shops and small clothing boutiques. I kept walking past this one shop window with a dress that caught my eye. Finally, I decided to go in to try it on, and ended up bringing it home with me! If you’re shopping for gifts for loved ones, I am sure you will find something special in Tubingen. MINGLE AT THE LOCAL BEER GARDEN As for visiting Tubingen, you can’t travel here without stopping at a beer garden! Gasthausbrauerei Neckarmüller is a favourite local spot, right on the Neckar River. It’s definitely one of my top things to do in Tubingen. Try the locally brewed beer while you admire views of the river from picnic tables lining the waterfront. It’s a great place to mingle with the locals while drinking some refreshing pints! When we visited, the World Cup was happening and everyone was sitting in front of an outdoor TV screen to watch the game. Unfortunately, Germany didn’t win the game when we were there, but it seemed as though everyone in town was crowded in front of a screen at a local beer garden, restaurant, or pub. SAMPLE THE TASTY CUISINE Justin and I ate lots of delicious vegan food in Tubingen. There are lots of vegan and vegetarian offerings at restaurants, which isn’t too surprising given the younger student demographic. Here are a few notable spots to check out when you’re in town. FAME DA LUPO Fame Da Lupo is a small Italian joint serving up fresh pasta and pizza. Justin and I ordered the vegetarian dish on the menu, a fairly basic pasta with tomato sauce, as well as a side salad. The portions were pretty big and the food was tasty. It was prepared surprisingly quickly, making it a great option if you’re looking for lunch on the go. WILLI Willi is a cafe spanning two floors, as well as an outdoor patio. There are many vegan dessert options clearly marked in their cabinet. I ordered a coffee and a delicious slice of cake here that was heavenly. Hip vibes, vegan desserts, and flavourful coffee – what more could you ask for from a charming cafe? VEGI Vegi is a vegetarian and vegan restaurant, primarily serving up falafels and pitas. Justin and I both ordered falafels stuffed into pitas, and then proceeded to stuff our faces with them. They have a small patio outdoors, which was a great spot for people watching while enjoying our food. WHERE TO STAY After enjoying all of the unique things to do in Tubingen, you’ll need somewhere comfortable to rest your head at night. We spent the night at Hotel Krone , located just across the Neckar River in the perfect spot. We could walk everywhere from the hotel. Our room was bright and spacious. There was high speed Wi-Fi, a Tassimo coffee maker in the room, and a breakfast buffet was included in our stay. We highly recommend booking your stay at Hotel Krone . See what other guests of the hotel are saying in their reviews. If you’d like to see more photos of Tubingen, please visit our entire travel photo gallery . You can even purchase prints, housewares, and many other items made from any of our photos from our travel photography site . If you’ve got an extra day in Germany before heading back to Frankfurt, or you’re looking to spend some time in a quaint German town, head straight to Tübingen. I’m sure you’ll fall in love like we did. Between sampling local beer, walking an avenue of ancient trees, or trying your hand at punting, there’s no shortage of unique things to do in Tubingen. We’d love to return to spend more time here as we know we’ve only scraped the surface of what Tübingen has to offer.

Δ laurie mahler Thursday 9th of April 2020 Having visited Stuttgart in 2017 to explore my German roots, meet family and see where my dad grew up, my cousin took me to Tubingen.

Here one can see curved narrow streets, paved with cobblestones, and ancient medieval houses. The city is famous for the Eberhard Karls University, the oldest university in Germany, where students study medicine, natural and social sciences. The main attractions of the city inсlude the bridge over the River Neckar (Nekkarbrücke), which literally teems with flowers during the warm season, as well as the St. Johannes Evangelist Church, which was built in the 19th century and is one of the most beautiful and important neo-gothic buildings in Baden-Württemberg. The undeniable symbol of the city is the Hölderlin Yellow Tower (Hölderlinturm), which one can see on all the postcards with views of Tuebingen. As any other German city, Tuebingen has a market square where the markets open in summer, and the famous chocolate festival takes place during the first week of December annually. During the festival, about 100 famous chocolate manufacturers from all over the world present their masterpieces.

The Neckar is a major right tributary of the Rhine . Rising in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis near Schwenningen in the Schwenninger Moos conservation area at a height of 706 m (2,316 ft) above sea level, it passes through Rottweil , Rottenburg am Neckar , Kilchberg , Tübingen , Wernau , Nürtingen , Plochingen , Esslingen , Stuttgart , Ludwigsburg , Marbach , Heilbronn and Heidelberg , before discharging on average 145 m 3 /s (5,100 cu ft/s) of water into the Rhine at Mannheim , at 95 m (312 ft) above sea level, making the Neckar its 4th largest tributary, and the 10th largest river in Germany. Since 1968, the Neckar has been navigable for cargo ships via 27 locks for about 200 kilometres (120 mi) upstream from Mannheim to the river port of Plochingen, at the confluence with the Fils . From Plochingen to Stuttgart, the Neckar valley is densely populated and heavily industrialised, with several well-known companies. Between Stuttgart and Lauffen, the Neckar cuts a scenic, meandering, and in many places steep-sided, valley into fossiliferous Triassic limestones and Pleistocene travertine . Along the Neckar's valley in the Odenwald hills many castles can be found, including Hornberg Castle and Guttenberg Castle [ de ; lb ; ru ; uk ] in Haßmersheim ; the now-mothballed Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant and the active Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant are also located there. The Neckar in southwest Germany flows from south to north, and joins the Rhine at Mannheim. Schwenninger Bog, the source of the Neckar The Neckar in Tübingen, between the Neckarinsel at the left and the Neckarfront of the old town at the right The Neckar near Neckarsulm Traditionally the fertile plains have been intensively used for agriculture and its steep valley sides as vineyards . Etymology [ edit ] The name Neckar may be derived from Nicarus and Neccarus from Celtic Nikros , meaning wild water or wild fellow . The grammatical gender of the name in German is masculine (der Neckar). Geography [ edit ] River course [ edit ] Drainage area Neckar catchment area Sources [ edit ] The headwater region of the Neckar lies in the Schwenninger Moos between Schwenningen and Bad Dürrheim . The traditionally marked spring of the river lies in the city park Möglingshöhe in Schwenningen. Prior to the Landesgartenschau Villingen-Schwenningen 2010, the Neckar flowed in the city center of Schwenningen mostly underground. In order to protect the city better from the more frequent flooding through overflow of the duct, the river received more space through a new, mostly open riverbed. This riverbed runs largely on the newly constructed horticultural show ground, which was used as the occasion for the remodeling. Headwaters Up to shortly before Rottweil the Neckar is only a small rivulet on the Baar plateau. In Deißlingen -Lauffen it has its only, 4 meters high, waterfall which is drained today. Afterward, the Neckar joins with the Eschach coming from the eastern slopes of the Black Forest which is much more water bearing. Its main tributary Glasbach, which originates at the Brogen, is hydrographically seen as the main river of the Neckar river system. With this junction above Rottweil the Neckar enters a narrow, wooded valley and for the next 80 km it bores its way towards north between the ranges of the Black Forest and the Swabian Jura . It has created two cut-off meander spurs at the Neckarburg which is spanned by the Neckarburgbrücke. Further down the river lies high above the river the old town of Oberndorf on a Calcareous sinter terrace , which fills one of the bowl-like side valleys. At Horb it turns from the Gäu Plateau towards north east and then follows the western side of the Swabian Jura ( Albtrauf ). Near Weitingen the valley is traversed by the 127 m high Neckar Viaduct of the A 81. At Rottenburg it enters the wider valley of Tübingen. After Tübingen the valley narrows again. From here onwards, the surrounding elevated grounds are considerably more densely populated. Middle reaches At Plochingen the Neckar turns sharply north west at the "Neckarknie" (knee of the Neckar), the mouth of the Fils coming down from the east, from the Swabian Jura. Beginning from here the river has been expanded into a canalised waterway. It lies up to Stuttgart in a wide, urbanized meadow, which has been built over with industry and is cut through by transportation structures. Only around the Cannstatter valley bend for a short distance it is interspersed by large park areas. Here again the valley sides show limestone-sinter. Between Stuttgart and Lauffen the Neckar cuts a scenic, meandering, and in many places steep-sided, valley into fossiliferous Triassic limestones and Pleistocene travertine . After Stuttgart it turns again towards the general northern direction. In a winding and narrow valley section through the Ludwigsburg (district) the Rems enters from the right at Remseck and then again from the right north of Marbach the Murr . After passing the Hessigheimer Felsengärten the water-rich Enz enters from the left at Besigheim . The former rapid at the Lauffener avulsion of the meander is today under water due to the canalization. In the Lowlands around Heilbronn the Neckar runs again through a wide meadow an open landscape. At Bad Friedrichshall it takes up within only two kilometers the other two of its large tributaries: First its water-richest tributary, the Kocher and then the officially longest, the Jagst , in total roughly doubling its discharge. Lower reaches Between Bad Wimpfen with its Stauferpfalz and Mosbach , the Neckar enters the Odenwald , where, again in a gorge-like valley, high, elevated, forested slopes line its riverside and especially on the right side, deeply cut valleys enter. At the last of his distinctive knees at Eberbach it turns west, enters at Hirschhorn for a short distance Hessian territory and is then up to Neckarsteinach on long parts the border between Baden-Württemberg and Hessen. At Neckargemünd the Elsenz enters from the left, its lower reaches using a part of the Neckars former Maurer river loop which extended far south. At the city of Heidelberg , which borders in the north the Odenwald and at the south the Königstuhl (Odenwald) , the Neckarvalley is cut in the deepest by over 400m through mountains. After passing the Heidelberger historic city, the river enters the wide Upper Rhine Plain and after further about 25 kilometers in Mannheim roughly at its middle it enters the Rhine from the right. Tributaries [ edit ] The largest tributaries of the Neckar are the Enz with the largest drainage area, the Kocher with the highest average water drainage and the longest one, the Jagst . The Kocher tributary Lein is at its end not only longer than the Kocher, but also more water-abundant. Therefore, according to hydrographic convention, the Lein would have to be regarded as the main river of the Kocher water system, making it with then 201 kilometers the longest tributary of the Neckar.

Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( December 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The primal Neckar started off as an escarpment riverlet due to the slow rise of the Black Forest and the connected slow erosive retraction of the South German Scarplands . Historic routes of the Neckar at the mouth For a long time it flowed on the high plains of the different Gäu Plateaus created through the hard chalks of the Muschelkalk . At Horb the river was redirected to the northeast due to the rift structure of the so-called Swabian Lineament , which lies roughly parallel to the escarpment of the Swabian Jura . Following that the Neckar cut into the Muschelkalk plateau between Rottweil and Rottenburg as well as the younger Keuper and Jura layers in the northeast, and created narrow water gaps in the area of the morphologically hard chalks and sandstones. Neckar mouth today The river deepening was also caused by the further rise of the Black Forest as well as the retracting erosion of the attacking younger Neckar route. This younger Neckar route tapped the primal [ clarification needed ] Neckar system at Plochingen (hence the Neckarknie ), which flowed through the primal lone to the primal Danube . Another influence on this river area was the Schurwald , a dissected cuesta of the filder rift, working as a river guideline. [ clarification needed ] Today's lower reaches used to be those of the primal Enz . Until, through the erosive retraction of a tributary of the primal Enz near Besigheim, the Neckar river network was tapped. [ clarification needed ] That is how the Enz became a tributary of the Neckar. [2] Another trace of the former north western extent of the Danube river network is the Eschach running from north west to south east, hence towards the primal [ clarification needed ] Danube. With the retraction of the escarpment, it was tapped by a Neckar tributary and redirected by about 90° to the east. Considering river history, [ clarification needed ] it was never a headstream of the Neckar. Until 2000 years ago the Neckar flowed through a pastureland in the Oberrheinische Tiefebene in a tangle of meanders, slings, [ clarification needed ] old waters [ clarification needed ] and cut of arms between the Rhine in the west and the foot of the Odenwald in the east until it finally entered the Rhine only north of Darmstadt at Trebur ; roughly 50 km north of today's confluence in Mannheim. On large stretches you can still see it [ clarification needed ] on aerial photos. In the 13th century, the confluence was south of Mannheim. A great flood changed the course of the Neckar in around 1275. Since then it enters the Rhine north of the city. The last change here took place in connection with the straightening of the Rhine by the Friesenheimer breakthrough west of today's Friesenheimer Island. Previously the Neckar entered the Rhine in the area of today's industrial port of Mannheim . Its new riverbed was also the reason for the relocation of the Neckar. [ clarification needed ] After the old Neckar was cut off in early 1869, it followed the path of the new Neckar breakthrough, which was finished [ clarification needed ] by 1880. [3] River landscape [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( December 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Natural landscape [ edit ] Narrow and widening valleys alternate along the Neckar's course. The narrows are mostly deepenings into the Muschelkalk plateau and the Buntsandstein below. Widenings developed in the area of morphologically soft clay and marl. Wide valley meadows also developed through the strong backfilling with Aue clay since the start of settlement in the Neolithic and the accompanying deforestation and soil erosion . In the area of the narrows the meander and cut-off meander spurs stand out. The meanders were formed through the primal Neckar, which sluggishly flowed through the almost even Muschelkalk plateau, forming the basic structures during the deepening phases and cutting into the hard Muschelkalk. The best known cut-off meander spur is the one at Lauffen ; it cut through in historical times and created a waterfall (historic: Laufen ). At the cutbanks one can find rocks, formed by the limestone of the upper Muschelkalk. For example, the rock gardens at Hessigheim . They lie on the marls and clays of the middle Muschelkalks and can sag in whole stone packages, so-called Schollen , down towards the Neckar. In the Odenwald narrow ravines and gorges lead into the Neckar from both sides, as for example, the Wolfschlucht and the Margarethenschlucht. Cultural landscape [ edit ] View from the Hessigheimer rock gardens into the Neckar valley Stone terraces at the Cannstatter Zuckerle , located on the Neckar slopes in Stuttgart The Neckar in Neckarsulm, in the background the coal power station of Heilbronn The Neckar loop around the Dilsberg castle , as seen from the Hinterburg Heidelberg , the Neuenheim riverside with the neckar meadow and the Heiligenberg Due to the risk of flooding the valley plains remained unsettled for a long time, but the nutritious and, due to its good structure, very arable land was intensively used for agriculture, and to a large degree the valley plains are still used agriculturally today. The fertile soil allows the cultivation of lucrative specialty crops like vegetables or hops , for example, between Rottenburg and Tübingen. Gravel pit quarrying in the valley plains takes away agricultural land, but created large lakes, nowadays used for recreational purposes. These borrow pits also became habitat for birds, amphibians and aquatic creatures. Such large borrow pits can be found for example near Kirchentellinsfurt and between Freiberg am Neckar and Pleidelsheim . The gravel bodies of the Neckar have an additional role as water reservoir and are in many places used for drinking water production. [4] The paths usually went over the heights and only crossed the valleys where there were fords over the Neckar. This changed with the onset of industrialisation in the 19th century. It brought fundamental conflicts regarding the land usage of the flat valley plain. Large even spaces became sought after for industrial sites. The Neckar was mostly straightened in order to prevent flooding and to gain areas for industrial buildings. The river itself was expanded over the course of centuries. With the development into a heavy shipping lane in the early 20th century, the last freely flowing parts between Plochingen and the mouth disappeared and the whole river in this part nowadays is characterized by dam areas. In the strongly textured Neckar area the valley became the only possibility for modern transportation infrastructure. Construction of railway lines and avenues in the valley plains changed the Neckar valley from a cultural to an industrial landscape. One example is the densely populated and industrialised Neckar valley between Plochingen and Bad Cannstatt , which harbors large companies such as Daimler AG (the maker of Mercedes Benz cars) and Mahle GmbH and recreational facilities with large area consumption like the MHPArena , the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle or the Cannstatter Wasen , the second-largest fair of Germany. The term Wasen gives a clue, that there used to be a floodplain on which the fair was held. Distinctive points in the industrial landscape of the Neckar valley are the high chimneys of the coal-fired power station Altbach/Deizisau and Heilbronn as well as the assembly halls of the Daimler-engine plant in Untertürkheim and the Audi plant in Neckarsulm. Along the Neckar's valley in the Odenwald hills many castles can be found, including Hornberg Castle and Guttenberg Castle in Haßmersheim ; the now-mothballed Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant and the active Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant are also located there. In contrast to the plains, the mostly steep slopes are often forested and in forestry use. The sun-exposed south-facing sites are frequently used for vineyards and are terraced with dry walls. There the local red wine grapes Trollinger , Schwarzriesling and Lemberger are cultivated, which are also traditionally mostly drunk in Württemberg . Especially the middle Neckar around Besigheim and Lauffen is characterized by in parts extremely steep vineyards, which can be cultivated only by hand. The vine terrasses at the Neckar together with the drainage area of the tributaries deliver the largest part of the cultivation area of the Württemberg wine region . The vineyards at the lower reaches from Heinsheim to Heidelberg are part of the Baden wine region . Until the end of the 19th century, vineyard cultivation was more extensive in the Neckar valley including unfavorable sites. Today these have been abandoned and gone fallow, reclaimed by wildlife. One example is the southern slopes of the Spitzberg above the Neckar near Tübingen. The river's course provides a popular route for cyclists , especially during the summer months. The slopes of the Neckar are preferred areas for high-level residential areas because they allow wide, unobstructed views. Renaturation [ edit ] The not regulated old Neckar at Freiberg am Neckar The diverse usage of raw water and waterway , as well for the production of hydropower brought with it substantial interventions into the ecological structure of the river. Multiple initiatives are advocated for the land restoration the Neckar, the ecological enhancement of the river network, the improvement of the water quality , improved flood control and the creation of attractive local recreational areas alongside the river. Only recently [ when? ] within the frame of the nationwide campaign lively rivers and the initiative Lebendiger Neckar (German: lively Neckar), it was begun to free it from its partly-existing concrete corset. The river has in parts been redeveloped as a local recreational area and habitat for animals and plants. It still remains a symbol of endangered nature with the highest power plant density in Germany. At an oxygen content of below 4 mg/L power plant owners have to run specially designed turbines to inject air into the water. As of 2003, no mass die-off of fish due to lack of oxygen had occurred for 20 years. [5] Climate [ edit ] The Neckar valley functions as a cold air basin , which means that under cloudless skies the heavier, cold, night air which develops on the sparsely vegetated plateaus and hills, flows into the basin and concentrates there. Especially during the cold season, such "cold lakes" can contribute to the creation of fog while all around on the plateaus the sun shines. The orography of the Neckar valley facilitates such inversive weather conditions. The Neckar valley is known for its wine cultivation climate and the cultivation of Trollinger , Lemberger , Kerner , Müller-Thurgau amongst other locally grown grape varieties. Wine cultivation has receded over the 20th century and cultivation of the "Württemberger Wein" is mostly restricted to the south-facing slopes with high radiation gain in the Neckar valley and its side valleys, as wine cultivation is labor-intensive and in Württemberg competitive only in the best sites. Navigation [ edit ] Various excavations of harbor installations and findings lead to the conclusion that the Neckar navigation already existed during the Roman Age in the first century. Especially on the lower Neckar. Main purpose was probably the transportation of construction material for the Limes and provisions. Later the Neckar navigation was probably restarted by the Franks. Historical Development [ edit ] Timber floating from 1100 [ edit ] Starting from 1100 the usage of the Neckar as a waterway with line boats and rafts has been attested. The river was already blocked by weirs in the surroundings of several cities during the High Middle Ages. In Heilbronn a harbour was mentioned for the first time in 1146. The Neckar privilege granted by Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV in 1333 allowed the free imperial city the construction of a weir. After its construction, the continuous traffic on the river was for several centuries blocked. An annoyance for the neighbours. The permission of passage for raftsman therefore had to be determined contractually. In 1342 Württemberg, the Markgrafschaft Baden and the free imperial city signed an agreement for the opening of the Neckar for rafts between Besigheim and Heilbronn. A treaty from 1476 between the free imperial city Esslingen, Württemberg and Austria fixed free rafting trade as well. The last raft went through Tübingen down the Neckar river on October 26, 1899. [6] The wood from the eastern Northern Black Forest was shipped through the Neckar and then Rhine up to Holland . Because of the developing seafaring the shipbuilding had a large demand for wood. The firewood from the Schurwald was combined to up to 260 Meter long rafts in Plochingen. Navigation from the 16th century onward [ edit ] The Neckar gained importance as a waterway in the middle of the 16th century due to the beginning upper German trade. Despite many interventions in the river course in order to improve navigation, the river which had a towpath , was because of dangerous rapids and shallows only navigable for smaller barges and this mostly only up to Heilbronn. Making the upper Neckar navigable was then pushed ahead by Christoph, Duke of Württemberg who got the necessary permission from Emperor Karl V. in 1553. The city of Heilbronn still insisted on its rights so that the river was blocked at Heilbronn which meant that the upper Neckar and therefore Württemberg remained cut off from the navigation coming from the Rhine. All shipped goods were subject to Heilbronner staple right . In the late 16th century, Duke of Württemberg, Frederick I had plans for the navigation passage but discarded those in 1598 and instead planned to construct a württembergian trade port in Kochendorf . – which was as unsuccessful as his successors plans to build one in Untereisesheim . During the times of need in the 17th century, the navigation was insignificant. Stift Neuburg und das Neckartal , Ernst Fries, around 1830 Immediately above Mannheim interventions were necessary due to regular floods. After 1622, smaller corrections were made at the back then-existing Neckar loops between Mannheims Feudenheim and today's Friedrich-Ebert-Bridge. Floods still occurred and threatened the city, lastly in 1784 and 1789. The situation was then relaxed through the straightening of the river bed by means of for breakthroughs in combination with the lowering of the river bed as well as fortifications and dams. [7] After consolidation of the situation in the 18th century, electoral palatinate market ships regularly travelled on the lower Neckar river. On the upper Neckar boats regularly travelled between Heilbronn and Cannstatt for several years around 1720; the expansion of the navigation to the Württembergian Plochingen further up the river failed due to the free imperial city of Esslingen . While the electoral palatinate shipping on the lower Neckar was quite successful, the shipping on the upper Neckar was soon stopped again as the river was not suitably enough expanded for a navigation and moreover no funding was available for the further upgrading. Württemberg and the Electoral Palatinate signed a trade agreement in order to start up the Neckar navigation between Mannheim and Cannstatt during a time of economical rise in the late 18th century. In 1782 the previous two and the free imperial city of Heilbronn agreed upon facilitations in the Neckar trade but which were only of administrative nature. The Neckar still remained blocked at the weir in Heilbronn. The Napoleonic times around 1800 brought a downfall to the Neckar navigation. On the one hand – because most parts of the lower Neckar area had fallen to Baden and the free imperial cities of Heilbronn and Esslingen to Württemberg – the many disputes and obstructions of the former small states did not hamper the trade anymore. But during the Continental System the navigation was restricted and ships and material were confiscated. The introduction of the Mannheimer Stapels ("Mannheim stable") in 1808 meant that the merchants of Mannheim gained control over almost all Neckar trade. During the German Campaign of 1813 only small ships travelled on the Neckar, mainly military transports. The Congress of Vienna demanded the freedom of traffic on the Neckar and Rhine rivers in 1814/1815. Continuous navigability with the Wilhelmskanal in 1821 [ edit ] Mouth of the Heilbronner Wilhelmskanal (right) into the side arm Heilbronn (old neckar) (left). The canal made the Neckar continuously navigable in 1821. The lock with the bridge is from 1884. The 550-meter-long Wilhelmskanal ("Wilhelms canal") was constructed in Heilbronn from 1819 to 1821. The reason was the bypassing of the entire weir area and many mills. After further river construction measures, the Neckar became navigable all the way between the Rhine and Cannstatt . A lock gate at the upper end of the canal could turn it during floods into a port of refuge which was, already in 1829, expanded into a port of transshipment. In 1827 the Mannheimer Stapel was lifted through which the Neckar navigators gained back free access to the Rhine river. The Rheinschiffahrtsakte ("Mannheim Act") from 1831 and in consequence of it the Neckarschiffahrtsordnung ("Neckar navigation regulations") from 1832 brought, through simplified regulations and tariffs a significant rise for the navigation. But because of its shallows and rapids the river was considered one of the most dangerous in Germany. In 1836 the Neckarschiffergilde ("Neckar shipping guild") was dissolved, which had since 1810 tried to gain a monopoly on the Neckar trade. With the ratification of the Neckarschiffahrtsordnung in 1842 all Guilds were dissolved and thereby economic freedom created. Chain Boat on the Neckar at Heilbronn From 1841/42 onwards the Heilbronn-based Neckar-Dampfschifffahrt introduced a regular passenger and general cargo transport from Heilbronn to Mannheim. Despite the usage of modern steam ships, horses still pulled the heavy barges on the towpath upriver. The reason was that the steam ships were not yet strong enough herefore. The competition of rail transport made steam ships as well as towing barges gradually uneconomic in the second half of the 19th century. Rafting on the other hand kept its importance, but adapted to the age of the railroad. Because trunks from the Black forest did more and more go by train to Heilbronn and only from there continued their trip on the water, a new rafting harbour was constructed in Heilbronn in 1875. Above Esslingen the rafting was only of little importance. The last raft passed the city on 28. Oktober 1899. A new recovery for the Neckar navigation came with the chain boat navigation begun in 1878. Despite the construction of a railroad line along the Neckar. Between Mannheim and Heilbronn steam towboats with attached barges were now able to pull themselves upriver on a 115 km long chain which had been put into the river. Through that, the trip between Mannheim and Heilbronn was shortened to two to three days. On the horse drawn ships it had previously taken five to eight days. But often the water depth was not deep enough. The vernacular name for the chain boats was Neckaresel ("Neckar donkey"). The last chain boat navigation was still done 1933 – 1935 between Neckargerach and the barrage Kochendorf. The world's first motorboat made during the summer of 1886 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach was named "Neckar" when their Standuhr ( grandfather clock ) petrol engine was tested on the river near Bad Cannstatt. [ citation needed ] The motorized cargo navigation began on the Neckar in 1925. The first motor cargo ship on the river was ordered by the brothers Ludwig (1887–1955) and Jakob Götz (1890–1977) already in 1924 at the Anderssen Werft ("Anderssen shipyard"). It was put into service in 1925 and christened "Gebrüder Götz". [8] [9] The motor cargo ship was operated by the shipping company drove for the shipping company Ludwig und Jakob Götz, founded in 1920. One of the best known shipping companies on the Neckar, [10] which was also involved in the upgrading of the river to a heavy shipping waterway. [11] In 1946 the first transportation order for coal after the Second World War on the Neckar was awarded and shipped by Johann Friedrich Boßler with his motor cargo ship Elisabeth. [12] Upgrading to a heavy shipping waterway between 1921 and 1968 [ edit ] Neckar-Staustufe Hirschhorn with weir and double barrage In order to provide the rising industrial area around Stuttgart a waterway connection for fully rigged ships, first plannings for channelling of the Neckar between Mannheim and Plochingen began already in 1904. The goal was to be mostly independent from natural impacts as for example low waters or floating ice. With the Württembergian side Otto Konz (1875–1965) was assigned who remained connected to the Neckar upgrading the rest of his life. A memorandum from 1910 allowed for ships up to 1000 tons, according to plans from 1919 the transportation was planned for the 1200-t-ship. Because the Neckar was earmarked as a Reichswasserstraße (literally:"realm waterway") in the Weimar Constitution in 1919 (officially from 1. April 1921), Neckarbaudirektion (literally: "Neckar construction department") was introduced in 1920 whose head Otto Konz became. The department was directly subordinated to the German Reich (often called "Weimar Republic"). In 1921 the German Reich, the Neckar adjoining states Württemberg, Baden and Hessen agreed in a state treaty the upgrading of the Neckar to a heavy shipping waterway. In order to finance the construction project they founded the Neckar AG with a construction loan from the German Reich, the three States and several municipalities in the same year. As compensation the AG received the right to use the simultaneously expanded hydropower until 2034 and to redeem the construction loan with the profits; this right transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany. As chairman of the Neckar AG were elected Otto Hirsch from the Württembergian ministry of internal affairs and Otto Konz. In consideration of the world famous cityscape of Heidelberg and in order to bring the further barrages in unison with nature and landscape, the architect Paul Bonatz worked for the project (1877–1956). Construction began immediately along the entire distance in 1921. Along a stretch of 113 km length the first eleven barrages between Mannheim and the new canal harbour in Heilbronn were finished in 1935. This canal harbour became later through the further expansion the barrage channel Heilbronn. Navigation on the Neckar near Bad Wimpfen in 1988 with the passenger ship Neckarbummler of the Personenschifffahrt Stumpf The expansion of the Neckar to a heavy shipping waterway lead to a shipbuilding industry exclusively for the passenger traffic on the river. [13] Already in 1926 the brothers Georg (1881–1946) and Andreas Boßler (1884–1961) founded the Personenschiffahrt Gebr. Bossler , which makes the Gebrüder Bossler pioneers for passenger navigation on the Neckar. [14] [13] While the river was upgraded and the barrages constructed, the Neckar-Enz-Stellung , a defensive fortification against enemies approaching from the West was constructed between 1935 and 1938. It was based between Eberbach and Besigheim on the natural obstacle of the Neckar river and from thereon followed the Enz upriver up to Enzweihingen . Upgrading works were begun near Plochingen at the upper end of the intended waterway and plans existed to make the Fils between Plochingen and Göppingen navigable. The area for a harbour in Göppingen remained reserved in spatial planning until 1978. The construction chairman Konz also ordered the planning of a tunnel through the Swabian Jura for a waterway Ulm at the Danube in order to create a waterway between upper Rhine and upper Danube, as the State treaty from 1921 had planned. But those plans were dropped from 1968 onwards. After 1935 the upgrading slowed down. Until 1943 only six barrages above Heilbronn were constructed, but without locks. Hirsch was forced out of office and murdered in the KZ Mauthausen in 1941. Konz went into provisional retirement because of national socialist repressions. The constructions were mostly stopped during the second world war. Only in 1948 the barrage construction above Heilbronn was continued, until 1952 again led by Otto Konz. The section up to Stuttgart was finished in 1958 and Stuttgart harbour was opened by the president Theodor Heuß together with Otto Konz. With the opening of the Plochingen harbour in 1968 the expansion goal for the Neckar was reached after 47 years of construction. The river was dammed up at 27 locks and thereby had become a heavy shipping waterway from Mannheim to Plochingen. Every barrage consists of a weir with two to six openings and different gates, a double lock and a remote-controlled hydropower plant next to each other. At seven barrages, where a larger damming up was not possible due to the landscape, a parallel barrage and hydropower canal varying in length from 1.5 to 7.5 km has been constructed. At two further barrages a breakthrough exists which cuts of a river bend. In total only 17% of the entire distance from the Rhine up to the mouth of the Rems lie in an artificial waterbed, which means the river character dominates. On the last 32 km of the waterway in the area of the less water carrying upper river which is at the same time heavily used economically, almost the entire river bed had to be constructed artificially. Today [ edit ] Neckar river course near Stuttgart-Untertürkheim through heavily industrialized area Neckar at Stuttgart-Untertürkheim through heavily industrialized area The Neckar (Ne) is being administered after taking over step-by-step from the Neckar AG since 1970 from Mannheim to Plochingen as a Bundeswasserstraße (literally "federal waterway") by the water- and navigation offices Stuttgart and Heidelberg . The Federal Republic is owner of the waterway. Sport boats including paddle and rowing boats are subject to the Binnenschifffahrtsstraßen-Ordnung, valid on the Neckar which for example defines the need of identification and the rules for the right of way. 159 water abstraction points and 628 water intakes show the heavy water economical usage. On the Neckar, which is nowadays classified as a "Wasserstraße des Typs Va" (waterway Type Va) from km 201.5 at Plochingen to its mouth (km 0), 7332 river boats transported in 2012 7.5 million tons. The largest parts of these tons were made up of construction material (1,9 Millionen t) and coal (1,6 Millionen t) as well as salt (1,3 Millionen t). 21.000 TEU Containers were transported. [15] Leisure ships run by various companies travel on the river for tourists. On the upper Neckar the passenger navigation is handled by the company Neckar-Käpt'n . Stuttgart's Neckarhafen Heilbronn canal port with shipping traffic by the freight motor ships Wolfgang Krieger and Heiner Krieger of the shipping company Gebr. Krieger Harbour [ edit ] Plochingen harbour [ edit ] On December 8, 1954, the Neckarhafen Plochingen GmbH was founded. From 1960 until 1963 the last barrage was constructed near Deizisau . The construction of the Neckarhafen Plochingen started on April 29, 1964. The first ship landed in Plochingen on July 12, 1968, after it had been blessed with the name "Plochingen" by Gertrud Hartung, the mayor's wife. In the harbour 15 companies generated an annual revenue of about 500 to 600 Million Euro in 2004. Stuttgart harbour [ edit ] The Neckarhafen Stuttgart was constructed in two steps, from 1954 until 1958 and from 1966 until 1968. The harbour area covers a total area of 100 ha. The three basins including the federal waterway have a water surface of 30,7 ha. Cannstatt harbour [ edit ] The first Cannstatter "Hafen am Mühlgrün" was inaugurated by duke Eberhard Louis in 1713. It remained insignificant. Heilbronn harbour [ edit ] Main article: Heilbronn Harbour The Heilbronn harbour with a total factory area of 78 ha and a quay length of 7,2 km based on the turnover the 7th largest inland harbour in Germany (2010) and the largest of the Neckar. Over 50% of the Neckar turnover is done here. In total about 4 million tons per year. About 60% of the turnover are domestic trade , the rest are international goods and commodities. Additionally to commodities and construction material ( coal , Salt ) grain, iron, steel and timber are loaded. Mannheim harbour [ edit ] Main article: Mannheim Harbour The Mannheim harbour is one of the most important inland harbours in Europe and the second-largest in Germany. The harbour has a total water surface of 267,9 ha, additionally there is 863,5 ha land area. About 500 companies with 20.000 employees have settled in the harbour area. In 1968 the first Container -Terminal in an inland harbour was opened here. Furthermore, a RoRo -facility and since 1991 a combined transport terminal. On the water side 7.64 million tons of goods were turned over in 2010. [16] The largest stakes have bituminous coal 2.2 million t, food- and fodder with 0.92 million t and chemical goods with 1.59 million t. At the container terminal on the water side 120.568 units were turned over. [17] The harbour basin spreads out around the mouth of the Neckar along the Rhine and Neckar. The overall complex includes the Ludwigshafener Rheinhafen , which is situated directly on the opposite side of the Rhine river. Barrages [ edit ] Main article: List of barrages on the Neckar The maximum size of the river boats driving on the Neckar is limited by the locks of the 27 barrages. Those are in general 110 m long and 12 m wide; the allowed dimensions are therefore 105 m x 11.45 m. Since 1952 almost every Barrage got a second lock. 23 of those locks use almost 50% of the water of one chamber to fill the other empty chamber in order to save water (so-called twin locks ). In order to prevent jams at the mouth of the Neckar, the first barrage Feudenheim received a further lock in 1973 (190 m × 12 m). The barrages have an average distance of 7 km between each other (between 0.9 and 13.7 km, see table) and are used to cover the difference in altitude of 160.70 m to the Rhine at low water. The waterway depth is since 2000 continuously 3.80 m. This means that the Stuttgart harbour can be reached by the large motor ships of the Rhine, which have a draft of 2.6 m and a loading capacity of 2200 t. In the coming years it is planned to refurbish the locks and partly extend them. In total the federal government invests 575 Million Euro for this project. For its execution, the Amt für Neckarausbau Heidelberg was founded in 2007. In order to make the Neckar navigable for 135 m long ships, one of each dual lock chamber is going to be lengthened. Furthermore, the old chambers are going to be refurbished and certain sections and turn around spots expanded. The barrages between Mannheim and Heilbronn are supposed to be lengthened until 2026. [18] The Gundelsheim lock received the title "most water sport friendly lock" in 2012. Table of the locks at the Neckar with river kilometers and aimed stowage height in meters above Normalnull ( NN ) and difference in level ( de ) in meters. [19] The Cannstatt double lock The Hofen barrage The Aldingen barrage The Poppenweiler barrage The Feudenheim lock In contrast to other waterways as for example the Mosel or Main there are no boat locks except for Bad Cannstatt. Therefore, yachts and sailing boats are normally locked in the river boat locks. The rails installed at the other 26 barrages to pull boats from one side to the other are often in a bad condition or even unusable. In some places canoes can, if allowed by the locks staff, use the lock as well. This is especially used on group trips. Since 2004 the remote control center in Stuttgart-Obertürkheim (Fernbedienzentrale, FBZ) controls all locks from Deizisau to Stuttgart-Hofen on the upper Neckar. Stream gauge and flood [ edit ] Crucial for the professional and recreational navigation on the Neckar are its stream gauges. According to the Hochwassermeldeordnung (HMO, flood report regulation) of the State Baden-Württemberg the following Hochwassermeldehöhen are valid at the stream gauge : Gauge Water level Drainage Telephone number Rottweil [20] 230 cm 77m 3 /s 0741-8730 Horb [21] 270 cm 108 m 3 /s 07451-19700 Kirchentellinsfurt [22] 330 cm – 07121-19700 Plochingen [23] 300 cm 290 m 3 /s 07153-19429 Lauffen [24] 500 cm 600 m 3 /s 07133-19429 Gundelsheim [25] 340 cm – 06269-19429 Gauge Plochingen The gauge in Plochingen (since 1905) was the only gauge at the waterway that lay in free descent. In 1962 the moveable barrage in Deizisau was constructed. In order to keep water level differences caused by the barrage, a ridge was constructed about 100 m below the Plochingen street bridge and moved the gauge there. The large flood in February 1970 destroyed the ridge made of stones. Because the costs for a new ridge made out of concrete seemed to be too high, a more economic solution was found. Out of the stream gauges and discharge of the gauges in Wendlingen (Neckar-km 206,5 – for the upper Neckar) and Reichenbach (Fils-km 2,5 – for the Fils) water gauges and discharges are algorithmically calculated and published. Flood 1824: The most serious flood in the Neckar area happened in October 1824. Estimates conclude for a HQ 4000 , that means a return period of 4000 years. [26] A study has been done to clustering simultaneous occurrences of the Extreme Floods in the Neckar Catchment and the results shows the Neckar catchment has been divided into three major clusters. The first cluster mainly covers the western part and is bounded by the Black Forest and Swabian Alps. The second cluster is mostly located in the eastern part of the upper Neckar. The third cluster contains the remaining lowland areas of the Neckar basin [27] Freeze up [ edit ] 1709: From January 18 until January 28 and from January 31 until February 13 as well as shortly after February 13 until March 23 the Neckar was frozen up. [28] Structures [ edit ] Mills [ edit ] Old Neckar mill below Horneck Castle in Gundelsheim The hydropower of the Neckar drove numerous mills, of which some are surviving to today: In Rottweil a powder mill existed since the 15th century which merged to the Powder factory Rottweil in 1863. In Gundelsheim the building of the Alten Neckarmühle (old Neckar mill) dates back to 1604. The milling was stopped following the Neckar regulation. The last miller was Meister Batz around 1935/36. There is no equipment in place anymore, for a time it was used gastronomically. Worth seeing are a large stone with a coat of arms and old inscriptions. [29] Power stations [ edit ] At least since the early 20th century, power stations replaced the historical mills. Since then the Neckar has been used for commercial electricity production through hydroelectric power. Several transregionally known hydro plants can be found at the Neckar: In Horb the construction of a hydroelectric plant was begun at the island front at the level of the Schillerstraße in February 2010. It started producing electricity on April 13, 2011. The hydroelectric plant is expected to produce 2.3 kWh yearly in the future – enough in order to supply about 600 four-person households with electricity. Together with the already existing, refurbished facilities it has an average total power of 437 kW. The total investments were about 5.5 million Euro. [30] In Rottenburgs district Bad Niedernau the Wasserkraftwerk Bad Niedernau can be found. In Rottenburg am Neckar the two power plants Beim Preußischen and Tübinger Straße . Kombiniertes Wasser –a coal-fired power station in Kiebingen 1910 In Kiebingen the Rottenburger clock factory Junghans did run since 1903 their own power plant , which still produces electricity today. For the clock factory the plant run by water and steam was over-dimensioned, therefore the overproduction was sold. Today the historic powerhouse is under monumental protection. Despite its age, the power plant is a very modern plant with three characteristics: The turbines have an innovative scoop shape which has been developed with computer simulations, special Thordon-Turbine bearings and inflatable rubber dam. A fish pass recreates since the modernization the pervasiveness for the fish migration at the weir. [31] The hydroelectric plant Tübingen-Hirschau is located between Hirschau and Tübingen as well as the Wasserkraftwerk Rappenberghalde which was constructed in 1930. It was refurbished in 1999 and today the two Kaplan turbines produce together with the residual water turbine at the weir upstream in Hirschau 7 million kWh electricity per year. Per second more than 22 cubic metres of water flow through a 1.7 km long supply canal to the plant. The plant uses the incline of the Neckar of 7.5 meters. [32] Tübingen The Wasserkraftwerk Neckarwerk in Tübingen was constructed together with the weir within the frame of the Neckar regulation as one of the first roller dams in Germany in 1910/1911. It is used for electricity generation as well as control of the river. Through the weir the water level of the Neckar in Tübingen center is managed. Before the construction of the weir the Neckar was full of gravel banks and hat a very flat waterfront. This can be seen on many photographs and drawings prior to the construction. Moreover, floods, which now and then flooded the back then only few buildings in Wöhrd and sometimes threatened the Neckar bridge have been eliminated with this weir and the other weirs (e.g. in Rottenburg). For fish a fish ladder has been constructed later on. The pedestrian bridge over the weir is an important connection of the two waterfronts between Lustnau and the central Eberhards or Neckar bridge. It also provides a nice view of Neckar, historic city center, abbey church and castle. [33] The Oberesslingen power plant The Kraftwerk Oberesslingen is a run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plant between two Neckar islands at river kilometer 195.6 in Oberesslingen . The plant was constructed in 1929 in the frame of the upgrading to a heavy waterway according to a design made by the architect Paul Bonatz . It has a capacity of 2.1 MW and delivers per year about 12.3 GWh energy. The average flow ist 45 cubic meter per second. In Esslingen a new run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plant has been constructed on the Hechtkopf. With a power of 1.25 MW and a yearly electricity production of 7.1 GWh 4000 people can be supplied with electricity. With the construction of this new power plant the last of the barrages on the Neckar has been equipped with turbines. It is framed by a weir in the Neckar on one side and the historical bridge house over the Hammerkanal (hammer canal) on the other side. [31] The power station of Lauffen am Neckar in 1891 The Drehstromübertragung Lauffen–Frankfurt was on August 25, 1891, the worldwide first transmission of electric energy with high voltage alternating three-phase current . On the occasion of the International Electrotechnical Exhibition 1891 the electricity generated by the hydropower plant at the Mühlgraben in Lauffen am Neckar was upvolted to 15 kV and transported over 175 km to Frankfurt am Main where it did run an artificial waterfall. The power plant was moved up river during the upgrading of the Neckar. The original generator is now located in the Deutschen Museum (German Museum) in Munich. The hydropower plant Heilbronn lies on the old Neckar in the city center and not on the canal. Therefore, no lock exists here. Weir footbridge over the Neckar at the Wieblingen weir in Heidelberg (built 1925) At the Heidelberger Karlstor is another barrage with lock; the corresponding power plant is the only underwater hydropower plant at the Neckar. The construction permission the Neckar AG 1994 received for it in 1994 had a number of requirements. Neither were visible changes at the weir which is under monumental protection, nor should the new power plant change the historic cityscape of Heidelberg. The technical solution was a power plant embbeded invisibly under the riverbed. [31] At the weir in Heidelberg the weir bridge connects the city districts Wieblingen and Neuenheim. Additionally, the Neckar is and has been a cooling water supply for coal and nuclear power plants. Near Esslingen-Zell the Neckar cools the Altbach Power Station , one of the most modern bituminous coal power plants in Europe. It consists of two blocks and is located on the area of the two municipalities Altbach and Deizisau . It can including its gas turbines and the combination block 4 produce a maximum of about 1270 MW of electrical power. The Heizkraftwerk Stuttgart-Gaisburg , the incineration facility of the Kraftwerks Stuttgart-Münster , the Kraftwerk Marbach , the Kraftwerk Walheim , the Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Station , the Kraftwerk Heilbronn and the mothballed Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant source their cooling or evaporation water from the Neckar as well. Bridges [ edit ] Famous bridges include the Neckar Valley Bridge Weitingen , near the town Horb am Neckar and the Old Bridge , in Heidelberg. The ladder is amongst the best known historic bridges. It already existed in the High Middle Ages and was erected in today's form in 1788. Further historic Neckar bridges are the Neckarbrücke in Lauffen am Neckar, in the core dating back to 1532, the Neckar bridge in Sulz constructed in 1742, the Pliensaubrücke, the Alte Agnesbrücke (old Agnes bridge) and the Ulrichsbrücke in Köngen. The oldest still remaining Neckar bridge is the Innere Brücke in Esslingen . The 230 meter long construction was built in the 13th century and consists of eleven stone arches. [34] The Neckartalbrücke Heilbronn is with 1348 meter the longest Neckarbridge. The prestressed concrete construction built in 1967 is ailing and since early 2018 being replaced by a new bridge. [35] In Neckargröningen the 85-meter longest free spanning wooden pedestrian bridge was created in 1990. The unusual structure has a triangle profile. [36] Die älteste Spannbeton-Eisenbahnbrücke Deutschlands – erbaut 1957 – steht in Heilbronn. [37] In the year 1905, there were already 119 bridges over the Neckar, of which, with a total length of 230 meters, the longest was the Neckargartacher Neckarbrücke built between 1903 and 1905. In 1985 the heavy waterway was crossed by 159 railroad-, street- and pedestrian-bridges and also by 126 overhead power lines and 67 Düker . In total there are today about 400 Neckar bridges of various sizes, half of it on the upper and half of it on the middle and lower reaches. <!—counted on the OpenStreetMap-Map --> See also: List of Neckar bridges Castles and palaces [ edit ] From Mannheim over Heidelberg , Eberbach , Mosbach up to Heilbronn the Castle Road runs almost parallel to the Neckar and passes on this about 100 km long section of the lower Neckar numerous castles and palaces. Most notably the Heidelberg Castle zu nennen. Unter den Neckarburgen sind aber auch die vier Burgen in Neckarsteinach, Dilsberg Castle , Burg Eberbach , Burg Hirschhorn , Zwingenberg Castle , Burg Stolzeneck , die Minneburg , Burg Dauchstein , Schloss Neuburg (Baden) , die Hornberg Castle (the castle of Götz von Berlichingen ) and the Guttenberg Castle ( Deutsche Greifenwarte ), Horneck Castle , and Burg Ehrenberg .

Towers [ edit ] Rottweil Test Tower Fernmeldeturm Mannheim The Neckar in literature [ edit ] Germany, in the summer, is the perfection of the beautiful, but nobody has understood, and realized, and enjoyed the utmost possibilities of this soft and peaceful beauty unless he has voyaged down the Neckar on a raft. — Mark Twain , A Tramp Abroad Der Neckar poem by Friedrich Hölderlin Friedrich Hölderlin wrote a poem entitled "Der Neckar". [38] The Neckar is mentioned prominently in Gustav Mahler 's 1893 "Rheinlegendchen" ('Little Rhine Legend'), first published in 1899 in a cycle of 12 songs under the title Humoresken ('Humoresques'), today known as one of Mahler's Songs from Des Knaben Wunderhorn (Songs from The Youth's Magic Horn ).

Neckar flows into the Rhine. The source of the Neckar is in the nature reserve Schwenninger Moos in the Black Forest near Villingen-Schwenningen at a height of 706 m over sea level. The R. Neckar is navigable between Plochingen and Mannheim. Ports are located in Plochingen, Stuttgart, Heilbronn and Mannheim. Just as the Rhine, the R. Neckar is subject to numerous uses. The middle and lower course of the Neckar is impounded. The many uses of the river have fundamentally modified the ecology of the water course. Only the upper course of the R. Neckar has largely preserved its natural character. external link: Baden-Wuertemberg: http://www.wrrl.baden-wuerttemberg.de History of the ICPR Secretariat of the ICPR Did you know ... that, thanks to the R. Neckar, Father Rhine is supported by a “wild lad“? The name of the Neckar is of Celtic origin and means wild water or wild lad. It is derived from the primeval European word “nik” meaning to dash off.

Science Minister Olschowski: Continuing the Cyber Valley success story together: Strong partners create a unique AI Community for top international researchers. Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) continues to advance the Cyber Valley innovation campus. Tübingen, June 21, 2024 – At the finale of the Cyber Valley Days, and Science Minister Petra Olschowski opened the ELLIS Institute Tübingen , heralding the next phase of the AI Innovation Campus. With the world's first ELLIS Institute, Cyber Valley is gaining further radiance. Olschowski also announced at the ceremony that the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) is joining the Cyber Valley Community. "Together, we are continuing the success story of our Cyber Valley innovation campus. With KIT, we are not only gaining an excellent technical university, but also a research institution from the Helmholtz Association," said Science Minister Olschowski. "Together with the ELLIS Institute, this will create a unique AI ecosystem that offers top international researchers and start-up founders optimal conditions. The Cyber Valley Start-Up Network alone will soon include 70 AI companies - and three to five more start-ups join the network every month. The foundations of Europe's future technology, the AI of tomorrow, are thus being laid on our Cyber Valley innovation campus. Areas of application in society and business range from medical technology to agriculture and Industry 4.0." Cyber Valley combines basic research and practice "The opening of the first ELLIS Institute marks a milestone for AI research in Europe. The leading AI experts are visiting Tübingen and Stuttgart this week - and we want to continue to attract the best talent. The institute is set to become a home for excellent AI research in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, Europe and the world," said Prof. Dr. Bernhard Schölkopf, Scientific Director of the ELLIS Institute Tübingen. "Artificial intelligence is an integral part of research at KIT: whether in intelligent robots or in production machines, in innovative materials or autonomous vehicles, in climate research or in health technologies," emphasised Prof. Dr. Oliver Kraft, representing the President of KIT. "We are delighted that we can now actively contribute our expertise to the Cyber Valley innovation campus. Both KIT and the future partners will benefit from the collaboration and jointly drive forward pioneering innovations." Cyber Valley is based on scientific excellence and entrepreneurial innovation. The innovation campus is already recognised as a leader in machine learning and areas such as computer vision. The second phase, which has now been launched, will focus on topics such as the future areas of robotics and health with the Cyber Valley Health Cluster and Robotic Cluster. In addition, the newly opened ELLIS Institute Tübingen offers top international AI researchers the greatest possible freedom and attractive framework conditions for their work. Since its foundation, the Cyber Valley Community has been strategically expanded – now to include the ELLIS Institute and KIT. The latest addition will bring the strong AI regions of Stuttgart-Tübingen and Karlsruhe even closer together. Research transfer and social dialogue as important tasks In future, the Cyber Valley partners want to further strengthen the transfer of research and the ecosystem for AI start-ups in particular. The 67 start-ups that have already been founded in the Cyber Valley start-up network are active in a wide range of sectors, including healthcare, the construction industry, mobility and agriculture. Some of these AI start-ups have already raised millions from investors. In addition to research and transfer, Cyber Valley is also driving the social dialogue on AI: "Cyber Valley Public Engagement" provides information on the opportunities and challenges of AI applications and supports critical reflection. After all, artificial intelligence has the potential to fundamentally change our society and our lives. The overarching goal of Cyber Valley remains the same in the new phase: Baden-Württemberg should be at the forefront of AI worldwide.

Er gründet dort die Abteilung „Social Foundations of Computation“, welche die tiefgreifende Expertise des Instituts in den Bereichen Maschinelles Lernen, Künstliche Intelligenz, Robotik und physische Systeme um soziale Fragestellungen innerhalb der Informatik erweitert. Tübingen – Der Informatiker Moritz Hardt, Ph.D., folgt dem Ruf an das Max-Planck-Institut für Intelligente Systeme. Seit 1. Juli 2021 ist er im Nebenamt tätig, ab Januar 2022 wird er die Position in Tübingen in Vollzeit antreten. Seine neu gegründete Abteilung „Social Foundations of Computation“ – zu deutsch „Soziale Grundlagen der Informatik“ – setzt sich zum Ziel, soziale Fragestellungen in der Informatik zu verankern. Die Forschung soll zu einem Paradigmenwechsel innerhalb der Computerwissenschaften beitragen, der die Informatik von Grund auf als eine Sozialwissenschaft behandelt, welche die Rolle der Gesellschaft als Ganzes sowie die Handlungen und das dynamische Verhalten von Individuen miteinkalkuliert – insbesondere dann, wenn Algorithmen einen Einfluss auf die Lebensrealität von Menschen haben. Berechnungen als eine Form des sozialen Handelns sehen „Unsere Forschung wird das Zusammenspiel zwischen Algorithmen und der Gesellschaft untersuchen“, sagt Moritz Hardt. „Wir möchten nicht nur vereinzelte Konsequenzen der Technologie erforschen, sondern algorithmische Methoden entwickeln, die soziale Grundlagen von vornherein beachten. Das Ziel ist eine soziale Sichtweise auf die Computerwissenschaften zu entwickeln, die die Disziplin selbst zu einer Sozialwissenschaft erweitert.“ Erst seit kurzem wächst eine globale Forschungsgemeinschaft in den Computerwissenschaften heran, die die Menschen in den Vordergrund rückt und algorithmische Entscheidungsprozesse hinterfragt, die auf Daten basieren, die oft sensibel sind. Das Thema Fairness begann vor etwa fünf Jahren zu einem zentralen Forschungsschwerpunkt innerhalb der Machine Learning Community zu werden, welcher heute mehr denn je Beachtung findet. Mit der Berufung von Moritz Hardt leistet die Max-Planck-Gesellschaft einen Beitrag zur Stärkung der Grundlagenforschung innerhalb der Computerwissenschaften, die den sozialen Kontext sowie Normen und Werte als einen festen Bestandteil von Algorithmen sieht. Jedes statistische Modell, jede Vorhersage oder Berechnung solle auf einer sozialen Grundlage fußen, vor allem, wenn ein Computer und nicht ein Mensch Entscheidungen trifft, benennt Hardt seinen Anspruch. „Moritz Hardt hat fundamentale mathematische und algorithmische Beiträge zur Wechselwirkung zwischen Methoden des maschinellen Lernens und Ihrer gesellschaftlichen Einbettung geleistet. Wir freuen uns sehr, dass er seine Forschung am MPI-IS weiterführen wird, um gemeinsam eine künstliche Intelligenz zu entwickeln, die ihre Verantwortung für die Gestaltung unserer Zukunft in den Vordergrund rückt“, sagt Bernhard Schölkopf, geschäftsführender Direktor des MPI für Intelligente Systeme. „Informatik entwickelte sich an der Gesellschaft vorbei“ Hardt, der 2011 an der University of Princeton promoviert wurde, hat sich schon früh zu Beginn seiner Doktorarbeit mit dem Thema Datenschutz und Fairness bei der Klassifizierung sensibler Daten beschäftigt, als dieses Thema innerhalb der Community noch kaum bis keinerlei Zuspruch fand. „Ich bin dann über meine Arbeit an Differential Privacy auf soziale Fragestellungen gestoßen. Ich habe gemerkt, dass es sich nicht nur um Privatsphäre dreht, sondern viele andere Themen, die in der Informatik bis dahin über Jahrzehnte weitgehend ignoriert wurden. Die Disziplin Informatik hatte sich an der Gesellschaft vorbei entwickelt. Selbst heute werden soziale Probleme oft als Konsequenzen der Technologie eingestuft und nicht als zentraler Forschungsgegenstand“, so Hardt. Die neue Abteilung „Social Foundations of Computation“, die von Hardt geleitet wird, basiert auf vier Forschungsschwerpunkten: Die Anwendung von Methoden des Maschinellen Lernens in sozialen und ökonomischen Kontexten, die Formulierung von sozialem und dynamischem Handeln als mathematische Modelle, die Untersuchung von Gültigkeit und Zuverlässigkeit statistischer Methoden sowie die Entwicklung von Datensätzen innerhalb von Forschungsgemeinschaften. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt ist die Etablierung normativer Ziele in der Informatik und insbesondere die Frage, wie man Werte und Normen mathematisch formuliert. „Mein Ziel als Direktor am Institut ist es, anderen Forschenden die Arbeit an zukunftsweisenden Fragestellungen zu erleichtern, denen derzeit noch zu wenig Aufmerksamkeit zukommt“, sagt Hardt. Mit Celestine Mendler-Dünner hat bereits die erste Gruppenleiterin innerhalb der neuen Abteilung ihre Arbeit am Tübinger Standort des MPI-IS begonnen. Ihr Forschungsschwerpunkt liegt auf der Modellierung sozialer Dynamiken und wie man diese in die Entwicklung von maschinellen Lernalgorithmen mit einbeziehen kann. Sie hat bereits in Berkeley mit Moritz Hardt zusammengearbeitet und die Ausrichtung der neuen Abteilung mitgeprägt. Weitere Anstellungen werden zeitnah folgen. Die neue wissenschaftliche Abteilung soll insgesamt auf ca. zwei Dutzend Mitglieder anwachsen. Bevor Moritz Hardt zum Direktor ans MPI-IS berufen wurde, war er Assistenzprofessor in der Fakultät Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences an der University of California, Berkeley. Er promovierte in Informatik an der Princeton University mit einer Dissertation über Datenschutz und Fairness bei der Klassifizierung sensibler Daten. Anschließend war er bei IBM Research und Google tätig. Hardt ist Mitbegründer der Konferenz „Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning“. Er ist Ko-Autor der Bücher „Fairness and Machine Learning: Limitations and Opportunities“ (MIT Press, 2022) und „Patterns, Predictions, and Actions: A Story About Machine Learning“ (Princeton University Press, 2022).

Er gründet dort die Abteilung „Social Foundations of Computation“, welche die tiefgreifende Expertise des Instituts in den Bereichen Maschinelles Lernen, Künstliche Intelligenz, Robotik und physische Systeme um soziale Fragestellungen innerhalb der Informatik erweitert. Tübingen – Der Informatiker Moritz Hardt, Ph.D., folgt dem Ruf an das Max-Planck-Institut für Intelligente Systeme. Seit 1. Juli 2021 ist er im Nebenamt tätig, ab Januar 2022 wird er die Position in Tübingen in Vollzeit antreten. Seine neu gegründete Abteilung „Social Foundations of Computation“ – zu deutsch „Soziale Grundlagen der Informatik“ – setzt sich zum Ziel, soziale Fragestellungen in der Informatik zu verankern. Die Forschung soll zu einem Paradigmenwechsel innerhalb der Computerwissenschaften beitragen, der die Informatik von Grund auf als eine Sozialwissenschaft behandelt, welche die Rolle der Gesellschaft als Ganzes sowie die Handlungen und das dynamische Verhalten von Individuen miteinkalkuliert – insbesondere dann, wenn Algorithmen einen Einfluss auf die Lebensrealität von Menschen haben. Berechnungen als eine Form des sozialen Handelns sehen „Unsere Forschung wird das Zusammenspiel zwischen Algorithmen und der Gesellschaft untersuchen“, sagt Moritz Hardt. „Wir möchten nicht nur vereinzelte Konsequenzen der Technologie erforschen, sondern algorithmische Methoden entwickeln, die soziale Grundlagen von vornherein beachten. Das Ziel ist eine soziale Sichtweise auf die Computerwissenschaften zu entwickeln, die die Disziplin selbst zu einer Sozialwissenschaft erweitert.“ Erst seit kurzem wächst eine globale Forschungsgemeinschaft in den Computerwissenschaften heran, die die Menschen in den Vordergrund rückt und algorithmische Entscheidungsprozesse hinterfragt, die auf Daten basieren, die oft sensibel sind. Das Thema Fairness begann vor etwa fünf Jahren zu einem zentralen Forschungsschwerpunkt innerhalb der Machine Learning Community zu werden, welcher heute mehr denn je Beachtung findet. Mit der Berufung von Moritz Hardt leistet die Max-Planck-Gesellschaft einen Beitrag zur Stärkung der Grundlagenforschung innerhalb der Computerwissenschaften, die den sozialen Kontext sowie Normen und Werte als einen festen Bestandteil von Algorithmen sieht. Jedes statistische Modell, jede Vorhersage oder Berechnung solle auf einer sozialen Grundlage fußen, vor allem, wenn ein Computer und nicht ein Mensch Entscheidungen trifft, benennt Hardt seinen Anspruch. „Moritz Hardt hat fundamentale mathematische und algorithmische Beiträge zur Wechselwirkung zwischen Methoden des maschinellen Lernens und Ihrer gesellschaftlichen Einbettung geleistet. Wir freuen uns sehr, dass er seine Forschung am MPI-IS weiterführen wird, um gemeinsam eine künstliche Intelligenz zu entwickeln, die ihre Verantwortung für die Gestaltung unserer Zukunft in den Vordergrund rückt“, sagt Bernhard Schölkopf, geschäftsführender Direktor des MPI für Intelligente Systeme. „Informatik entwickelte sich an der Gesellschaft vorbei“ Hardt, der 2011 an der University of Princeton promoviert wurde, hat sich schon früh zu Beginn seiner Doktorarbeit mit dem Thema Datenschutz und Fairness bei der Klassifizierung sensibler Daten beschäftigt, als dieses Thema innerhalb der Community noch kaum bis keinerlei Zuspruch fand. „Ich bin dann über meine Arbeit an Differential Privacy auf soziale Fragestellungen gestoßen. Ich habe gemerkt, dass es sich nicht nur um Privatsphäre dreht, sondern viele andere Themen, die in der Informatik bis dahin über Jahrzehnte weitgehend ignoriert wurden. Die Disziplin Informatik hatte sich an der Gesellschaft vorbei entwickelt. Selbst heute werden soziale Probleme oft als Konsequenzen der Technologie eingestuft und nicht als zentraler Forschungsgegenstand“, so Hardt. Die neue Abteilung „Social Foundations of Computation“, die von Hardt geleitet wird, basiert auf vier Forschungsschwerpunkten: Die Anwendung von Methoden des Maschinellen Lernens in sozialen und ökonomischen Kontexten, die Formulierung von sozialem und dynamischem Handeln als mathematische Modelle, die Untersuchung von Gültigkeit und Zuverlässigkeit statistischer Methoden sowie die Entwicklung von Datensätzen innerhalb von Forschungsgemeinschaften. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt ist die Etablierung normativer Ziele in der Informatik und insbesondere die Frage, wie man Werte und Normen mathematisch formuliert. „Mein Ziel als Direktor am Institut ist es, anderen Forschenden die Arbeit an zukunftsweisenden Fragestellungen zu erleichtern, denen derzeit noch zu wenig Aufmerksamkeit zukommt“, sagt Hardt. Mit Celestine Mendler-Dünner hat bereits die erste Gruppenleiterin innerhalb der neuen Abteilung ihre Arbeit am Tübinger Standort des MPI-IS begonnen. Ihr Forschungsschwerpunkt liegt auf der Modellierung sozialer Dynamiken und wie man diese in die Entwicklung von maschinellen Lernalgorithmen mit einbeziehen kann. Sie hat bereits in Berkeley mit Moritz Hardt zusammengearbeitet und die Ausrichtung der neuen Abteilung mitgeprägt. Weitere Anstellungen werden zeitnah folgen. Die neue wissenschaftliche Abteilung soll insgesamt auf ca. zwei Dutzend Mitglieder anwachsen. Bevor Moritz Hardt zum Direktor ans MPI-IS berufen wurde, war er Assistenzprofessor in der Fakultät Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences an der University of California, Berkeley. Er promovierte in Informatik an der Princeton University mit einer Dissertation über Datenschutz und Fairness bei der Klassifizierung sensibler Daten. Anschließend war er bei IBM Research und Google tätig. Hardt ist Mitbegründer der Konferenz „Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning“. Er ist Ko-Autor der Bücher „Fairness and Machine Learning: Limitations and Opportunities“ (MIT Press, 2022) und „Patterns, Predictions, and Actions: A Story About Machine Learning“ (Princeton University Press, 2022).

Schmid) Project description: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease involving the motor system, which often leads to the death of the Patient within a few years. The neuronal disease mechanisms of ALS are often described based on animal models or investigations of dead human brain tissue. Here, the team used novel methodology, ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (7T-MRI), to gain a more precise insight on the acute disease state of the primary motor cortex (M1) in the living patient as well as its development over time. They show that a single 7T-MRI scan can be used to detect affected brain tissue in different layers of M1, and uncovers its development over time. The team could use this data to develop individualized disease profiles of M1 in living patients, which shows the potential of ultra-high field MRI for personalized diagnostics and therapy.

Many questions about the second competition phase have already been answered in our FA Q . If you have any further questions about the Clusters of Excellence funding line, please send them to our mailbox exzellenzcluster@dfg.d e . Funding Lines Based on the administrative agreement reached by the federal and state governments on 16 June 2016 and updated on 4 November 2022, the DFG and the German Council of Science and Humanities are implementing the Excellence Strategy in two funding lines: Clusters of Excellence (EXC) The Clusters of Excellence funding line is designed to support project-based funding in internationally competitive fields of research at universities or university consortia. The DFG is responsible for developing and implementing this funding line and for publishing calls for proposals every 7 years. Proposals are reviewed and decided on in an academically driven, competitive process. New initiatives go through a draft proposal and full proposal phase. In the first funding period (1 January 2019 to 31 December 2025) a total of 57 Clusters are being funded with an annual budget of 385 Mio. Euro. In the second funding period (1 January 2026 to 31 December 2032) up to 70 Clusters of Excellence can be funded with an annual budget of 539 Mio. Euro. Information on the Funding Line Cluster of Excellence (EXC ) Universities of Excellence (EXU) The Universities of Excellence funding line serves to strengthen universities as individual institutions or as university consortia in the long term and further develop their leading international role based on successful Clusters of Excellence. The German Council of Science and Humanities is responsible for developing and implementing this funding line. In the first funding period (2019 to 2026) ten Universities of Excellence and one University Consortium of Excellence are being funded with 148 Mio Euro annually. In the second funding period (2027 to 2033) up to four additional Universities or University Consortia of Excellence may receive funding. The next call for draft proposals for the second competition phase is expected to be issued in 2024. Information on the Funding Line Universities of Excellence (EXU ) Additional Programme Information Schedule for the Excellence Strategy On 29 – 30 November 2021, the Committee of Experts adopted an initial schedule for the second competition phase of the Excellence Strategy. Schedule as PDF downloa d Clusters of Excellence funding line: The second competition phase starts with the call for EXC draft proposal s on 15 December 2022. We ask that all new initiatives submit a letter of intent by 1 February 2023. For existing Clusters of Excellence planning a renewal proposal, it will, contrary to our previously communicated plans, not be necessary to submit letters of intent at such an early stage. The deadline for the submission of draft proposals for new Clusters of Excellence is 31 May 2023. Renewal proposals do not submit draft proposals. The review of the draft proposals will take place approximately between the end of August and mid-November 2023 and the final decision on the draft proposals for new Clusters of Excellence will be made on 1 February 2024. Only those initiatives invited by the Committee of Experts are eligible to submit a proposal. In advance of the proposal submission, we request an update on the letters of intent by 15 April 2024, so as to be able to incorporate any interim changes in the review schedule. Clusters of Excellence planning a renewal proposal are requested to submit a letter of intent by 29 January 2024. The submission deadline for all EXC proposals is 22 August 2024, with review of proposals scheduled from approximately early October 2024 to mid-February 2025. The funding decision on the future Clusters of Excellence will be made on 22 May 2025. The DFG guidelines serve as baseline standards for all reviews in the context of the Clusters of Excellence funding line. Guidelines for Avoiding Conflicts of Interes t Universities of Excellence funding line: The new call for proposals under the Universities of Excellence funding line is expected to start at the end of March 2024. Based on the decisions regarding the Clusters of Excellence in May 2025, new proposals will have to be submitted by mid-November the same year. From April to June 2026, site visits will take place in order to enable the Excellence Commission to arrive at decisions on four new projects in the programme line at the end of September 2026. The evaluation of the ten funded Universities of Excellence and the Excellence Network will begin with the submission of self-evaluation reports in August 2025. Site visits will take place from October to December the same year; in March 2026, the Committee of Experts will assess the results of the individual evaluations and submit their recommendation to the Excellence Commission accordingly. Further information on the Excellence Universities funding line can be found on the German Council of Science and Humanities websit e . Decision-Making Bodies Decisions on draft proposals and full proposals in the Excellence Strategy are made by the Committee of Experts and the Excellence Commission, respectively . The Committee of Experts consists of 39 members with proven research track records who represent the entire range of academic disciplines. In addition, they have extensive experience in international settings, in university management, in teaching or in the private sector. The Chair of the German Council of Science and Humanities and the President of the DFG are non-voting members of the committee and preside over it. The tasks of the Committee of Experts include defining the funding criteria, evaluating the draft and full proposals on the basis of peer reviews, making funding recommendations to the Excellence Commission, deciding on the draft proposals that qualify for submission of a full proposal, and assessing the results of the evaluation of the Universities of Excellence. The Excellence Commission consists of the Committee of Experts and the government ministers responsible for research at the federal and state levels. The Excellence Commission decides on the funding of Clusters of Excellence and Universities of Excellence on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee of Experts..

Ich werde hiermit auf Folgendes hingewiesen: I assure to have given the above information correct and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. The following 3 sections have been pointed out to me: Je certifie avoir effectué les déclarations ci-dessus en toute conscience et je suis informé(e) des points suivants: Ich bin verpflichtet, meine Belange und für mich günstige Umstände, soweit sie nicht offensichtlich oder bekannt sind, unter Angabe nachprüfbarer Umstände unverzüglich geltend zu machen und die erforderlichen Nachweise über meine persönlichen Verhältnisse, sonstige erforderliche Bescheinigungen, Erlaubnisse und Nachweise unverzüglich beizubringen. Nach Ablauf der dafür von der Ausländerbehörde gesetzten Frist geltend gemachte Umstände und beigebrachte Nachweise können unberücksichtigt bleiben (§ 82 Abs.1 AufenthG). I am obliged to assert immediately my interests and for me favourable circumstances, in case they are not known or obvious, by information that can be checked and to bring immediately necessary proves about my personal circumstances, any other necessary certificates, permits and proves. The period for bringing in the documents is established by the authority for residence affairs. Documents brought in after the deadline has expired or circumstances asserted after this period then can be left out of consideration (§ 82 Section 1 Residence Act). Je dois faire valoir immédiatement tous les éléments favorables me concernant (état civil, situation de famille, ressources etc.) et apporter les preuves correspondantes sauf si les informations sont déjà connues ou manifestes. L´administration se réserve le droit de ne pas tenir compte des documents transmis hors délai (§ 82 I loi de permis de séjour). * Falsche oder unvollständige Angaben zum Zwecke der Erlangung eines Aufenthaltstitels stellen einen Ausweisungsgrund nach § 55 ABS. 2 Nr. 1 AufenthG dar und können zur Ausweisung (§ 55 Abs. 1 AufenthG) oder zur Versagung des Aufenthaltstitels (§ 5 Abs. 1 Nr. 2 AufenthG) führen. Wrong or incomplete information made for the reason of obtaining a residence permit constitute a reason for deportation according to § 55 section 2 Nr. 1 residence act and can lead to deportation (§ 55 Section 1 residence act) or to the denial of a residence permit (§ 5 section1 Nr. 2 residence act). Des informations fausses ou incomplètes en vue de l´acquisition d´un permis de séjour représentent un motif pour l´expulsion (§ 55 II Nr. I loi de permis de séjour) et peuvent mener a l´expulsion (§ 55 I I loi de permis de séjour) ou au refus du permis de séjour (§ 5 I NR. 2 I loi de permis de séjour). * Mit Freiheitsstrafe bis zu drei Jahren oder mit einer Geldstrafe wird bestraft, wer unrichtige oder unvollständige Angaben macht oder benutzt, um für sich oder einen Anderen einen Aufenthaltstitel zu beschaffen oder einen so beschafften Aufenthaltstitel wissentlich zur Täuschung im Rechtsverkehr zu verwenden (§ 95 Abs. 2 Nr. 2 AufenthG). Any person who gives or uses wrong or incomplete information with the aim of obtaining for himself or for other persons a residence permit or of using a such obtained residence permit with the intention to deceive the law will be sentenced to up to three years imprisonment or to a fine (§ 95 section 2 Nr. 2 residence act). Celui ou celle qui, par tromperie, donne ou utilise sciemment des informations fausses ou incomplètes pour se procurer un permis de séjours ou qui utilise un permis de séjour obtenu sur la base d´informations fausses ou incomplètes encourt une peine de prison pouvant aller jusqu´ à trois années ou une peine d´ amende (§ 95 II nr. 2 loi de permis de séjour). * zurück / back / retour weiter / continue / continuer Schritt {1} von {2} / Step 4 of 4 / Étape 4 sur 4 Hinweis / Notice / Remarque Persönliche Angaben / Personal data / Données personnelles Erklärung / Explanation / Explication Ihr Anliegen / Your request / Votre demande Ihr Anliegen / Your request / Votre demande Telefon-Nummer / Phone number / Numéro de téléphone E-Mail-Adresse / E-mail-address / Adresse électronique Mit der Angabe meiner E-Mail-Adresse erkläre ich mich einverstanden, dass ich von der Ausländerbehörde in allen aufenthaltsrechtlichen Fragen per E-Mail kontaktiert werde.

Legal basis Article 22 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union No more applications possible! Union citizens can no longer apply for entry in the voters’ register. The deadline for application ended on 19 May 2024 . Exceptions are made only where it can be proven that the application deadline was missed by the Germans living abroad through no fault of their own (Section 24 (2) no. 1 of the European Electoral Regulations - EuWO). Please note that the right to vote may be exercised only once and only personally. Am I entitled to vote in Germany? Union citizens residing in Germany can take part in European elections in Germany if, on election day, they have reached the age of sixteen years, they have had a domicile or have otherwise been permanently resident for at least three months in the Federal Republic of Germany or in the other member states of the European Union, and are not disqualified from voting in the Federal Republic of Germany or in their member state of origin. Legal basis Section 6 (3) of the European Elections Act (EuWG) Back to top How can I take part in the election in Germany? A Union citizen who wants to go to the polls in Germany has to be on the voters’ register. Registration ex officio Union citizens entitled to vote will ex officio be entered in a voters’ register by the competent municipal authority if they were enrolled in a voters’ register in the Federal Republic of Germany for the European Parliament election of 13 June 1999 or a later European election, provided they are registered with a residents’ registration office on the 42 nd day before the election (= 28 April 2024) and had not departed to a foreign country in the meantime. Like all others entitled to vote, they will receive a voter’s notification from the municipal authority by the 21 st day before the election at the latest. Union citizens who moved abroad and returned to the Federal Republic of Germany have to re-apply for entry in a voters’ register. Registration upon application Union citizens who are not entered ex officio into a voters’ register (see no. 1.) have to submit a formal application to be registered. The application must have been received by the municipality of their place of residence on the 21 st day before election (= 19 May 2024) at the latest. This period cannot be extended. The application has to bear the applicant’s personal handwritten signature; its original must be submitted to the competent municipal authority. The application must not be sent by e-mail or fax. You may download the application form from this webpage as pdf file. It contains an information leaflet with instructions for completing the form. Printed application forms are available in the electoral office of your municipality.

Legal bases Section 4 of the European Elections Act (EuWG) in conjunction with Section 54 (2) of the Federal Elections Act (BWG) Sections 17a, 17b (1) of the European Electoral Regulations (EuWO) Back to top Can I vote in the member state I come from? Union citizens wishing to elect European parliament members from their country of origin should contact the competent agency of that country for more information. The foreign missions of the respective countries of origin provide further information on legal aspects and the relevant procedures. If you are listed ex officio in a voters’ register in Germany (see question “How can I take part in the election in Germany?”, no. 1) but want to exercise your right to vote in the country you come from, you have to file a written request with the competent municipal authority by the 21 st day before the election (= 19 May 2024) at the latest, stating that you do not want to be on their voters' register. As the de-registration will be permanent, you will have to apply to be registered again if you should wish to vote in Germany in any future European election (see question “How can I take part in the election in Germany?”, no. 2). You may download the application form from this webpage as pdf file. It contains an information leaflet with instructions for completing the form.

Our services include: Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it. To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms . And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us . Information Google collects We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful , the people who matter most to you online , or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity. When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information . Things you create or provide to us When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services. We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos. Information we collect as you use our services Your apps, browsers & devices We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low. The information we collect includes unique identifiers , browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address , crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request. We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps , your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name , crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device . Your activity We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include: Terms you search for Videos you watch Views and interactions with content and ads Voice and audio information Purchase activity People with whom you communicate or share content Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages , we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages. You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account. Go to Google Account Your location information We collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location. Depending on the products you’re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include: GPS and other sensor data from your device IP address Activity on Google services , such as from your searches or places you label like home or work Information about things near your device , such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information . In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources . For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse . We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf . We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies , pixel tags , local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches , databases, and server logs . Why Google collects data We use data to build better services We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes: Provide our services We use your information to deliver our services , like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts. Maintain & improve our services We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended , such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos. Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results . For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like. Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center . We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories , such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.

It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content. Browser web storage Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5. Cookies A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps .

Google Account You may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings. IP address Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet. Learn more about how we use location information. Non-personally identifiable information This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user. Personal information This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.

The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited. Sensitive personal information This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality. Server logs Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this: 123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 - http://www.google.com/search?q=cars - Chrome 112; OS X 10.15.7 - 740674ce2123e969 123.45.67.89 is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet. 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 is the date and time of the query. http://www.google.com/search?q=cars is the requested URL, including the search query.

(Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device). Unique identifiers A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed. Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies . On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.

KG und ihren verbundenen Unternehmen, einschließlich SoundCloud, Inc. und Repost Network Inc. (nachfolgend „SoundCloud“). Die in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie verwendeten Begriffe in Großbuchstaben, die nicht ausdrücklich definiert sind, haben die Bedeutung, die den entsprechenden großgeschriebenen Begriffen in den Nutzungsbedingungen von SoundCloud zugeschrieben wird. Das Thema Datenschutz ist uns wichtig. In dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie wird erläutert, wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten erfassen, speichern, nutzen, weitergeben und anderweitig verarbeiten, wenn Sie soundcloud.com und m.soundcloud.com (zusammen die „Website“), unsere mobilen und Desktop-Apps (die „Apps“) und alle damit verbundenen Websites, Player, Widgets, Tools, Daten, Software, APIs und andere von SoundCloud bereitgestellten Dienste (die „Dienste“) nutzen. Diese Datenschutzrichtlinie gilt für alle Websites, Apps oder Dienste von SoundCloud, die auf diese Datenschutzrichtlinie verweisen, d. h. einen Link zu ihr enthalten. Für Mitarbeiter mit Wohnsitz in Kalifornien können unsere Datenschutzhinweise für ehemalige, derzeitige und zukünftige Mitarbeiter und ähnliche Personen sowie deren Begünstigte und Notfallkontakte hier eingesehen werden. In dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie werden unter anderem folgende Punkte erläutert: Wer Ihre Daten kontrolliert Rechtliche Grundlage für die Datenverarbeitung Erfasste personenbezogene Daten Von Ihnen bereitgestellte personenbezogene Daten Automatisch erfasste personenbezogene Daten Von Drittparteien bereitgestellte personenbezogene Daten Wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verwenden Wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten weitergeben Cookies und ähnliche Technologien Informationssicherheit Internationale Datenübertragungen Kinder Unsere Social-Media-Aktivitäten Ihre Auswahl- und Kontrollmöglichkeiten Ausübung Ihrer EU-Datenschutzrechte Hinweis für kalifornische Nutzer Kontaktinformationen Änderungen dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie Informationen zu unserer Verwendung von Cookies und ähnlichen Technologien sind in unserer Cookie-Richtlinie enthalten, die Teil der Datenschutzrichtlinie ist. Wenn wir auf die Datenschutzrichtlinie verweisen, beziehen wir uns auf die Datenschutzrichtlinie als solche sowie auf die Cookie-Richtlinie. Bitte nehmen Sie sich etwas Zeit und lesen Sie diese Datenschutzrichtlinie sowie unsere Nutzungsbedingungen , um sicherzustellen, dass Sie unsere Verwendung und Offenlegung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten verstehen und damit einverstanden sind. Bitte beachten Sie, dass diese Datenschutzrichtlinie nur für die Website, Apps und Dienste (zusammen die „Plattform“) gilt. Bei der Nutzung der Plattform können Sie auf Links zu anderen Websites, Apps und Diensten oder Tools stoßen, die es Ihnen ermöglichen, Informationen mit anderen Websites, Apps und Diensten zu teilen. SoundCloud ist nicht für die Datenschutzpraktiken dieser anderen Websites, Apps und Dienste verantwortlich. Wir empfehlen Ihnen, die Datenschutzrichtlinien dieser Websites, Apps oder Dienste zu lesen, bevor Sie Ihr SoundCloud-Konto verbinden oder persönliche Daten teilen. Wenn Sie mit einer Bestimmung der vorliegenden Datenschutzrichtlinie nicht einverstanden sind, sollten Sie die Plattform nicht nutzen. Wenn Sie Fragen oder Bedenken hinsichtlich dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie haben, können Sie uns über das [Help Center] ( https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001107587-Privacy ) oder unter dataprotection@soundcloud.com kontaktieren. Bei SoundCloud stehen unsere Nutzer an erste Stelle. Aus diesem Grund möchten wir Sie darüber informieren, welche personenbezogenen Daten wir über Sie erheben, warum wir sie erheben und wie wir sie verwenden und weitergeben. Hierfür haben wir diese Datenschutzrichtlinie entwickelt – mit dem Ziel, Ihnen einfache, klare und umsetzbare Informationen über unsere Praktiken zum Schutz der Privatsphäre und des Datenschutzes zu geben. Wir sind der Meinung, dass die Nutzer außerdem die Möglichkeit haben sollten, die von uns erfassten, verwendeten und weitergegebenen personenbezogenen Daten (wie in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie, in Ihren [Einstellungen] (https://soundcloud.com/settings) und im Help Center beschrieben) selbst zu bestimmen. Wir möchten Sie daher anregen, diese Tools in vollem Umfang zu nutzen. Wer Ihre Daten kontrolliert Im Zusammenhang mit der Datenverarbeitung im Rahmen der internen Verwaltung von SoundCloud und gemeinsamen Verfahren durch zentrale Systeme fungieren SoundCloud Global Limited & Co. KG, SoundCloud Inc. und Repost Network Inc. als gemeinsam Verantwortliche. Die gemeinsamen Verfahren beziehen sich insbesondere auf den Betrieb und die Nutzung gemeinschaftlicher Datenbanken, Plattformen und IT-Systeme. In Bezug auf die gemeinsamen Prozesse bestimmt SoundCloud die Zwecke und Mittel der Verarbeitung. In einer gesonderten Vereinbarung über die gemeinsame Verantwortlichkeit gemäß Artikel 26 DSGVO legt SoundCloud fest, wie die jeweiligen Aufgaben und Verantwortlichkeiten bei der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten ausgestaltet sind und wer welche Datenschutzpflichten wahrnimmt. Dabei wird insbesondere festgelegt, wie ein angemessenes Sicherheitsniveau und Ihre Rechte als betroffene Person gewährleistet, die datenschutzrechtlichen Informationspflichten gemeinsam erfüllt und mögliche Datenschutzverletzungen überwacht werden können. Dazu gehören auch Berichts- und Meldepflichten. Für den Fall, dass SoundCloud nicht als gemeinsam für die Verarbeitung verantwortliche Partei auftritt, ist der alleinige für die Verarbeitung im Sinne der Datenschutzvorschriften Verantwortliche: Wenn Sie sich in den Vereinigten Staaten befinden: SoundCloud Inc., 71 5th Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York 10003, NY, USA, dataprotection@soundcloud.com . Wenn Sie sich außerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten befinden: SoundCloud Global Limited & Co. KG, Rheinsberger Str. 76/77, 10115 Berlin, Deutschland, dataprotection@soundcloud.com . Wir können Ihre Daten innerhalb unserer Gruppe von Unternehmen weitergeben, die durch gemeinsame Eigentumsverhältnisse oder Kontrolle miteinander verbunden sind („SoundCloud-Gruppe“). Die Daten von US-Nutzern können von SoundCloud Global Limited & Co. KG im Auftrag von SoundCloud Inc. verarbeitet werden. Die personenbezogenen Daten von Nutzern, die sich für SoundCloud Direct angemeldet haben, können von Repost Network Inc. unter dem Namen SoundCloud Direct im Auftrag des jeweiligen Verantwortlichen verarbeitet werden. SoundCloud bietet Statistiken und Einblicke in die Leistung einer bestimmten Tonaufnahme und der ihr zugrunde liegenden Komposition, die auf die Plattform hochgeladen wurde („Track“). Diese Statistiken und Einblicke werden jeder Person (einschließlich dem Urheber) oder Einrichtung zur Verfügung gestellt, die einen Track besitzt oder kontrolliert („Rechteinhaber“). Sie enthalten Informationen darüber, wie Fans mit ihren Tracks auf der Plattform interagieren, damit die Rechteinhaber ein besseres Verständnis ihrer Fanbasis gewinnen („Rechteinhaber-Insights“). Rechteinhaber-Insights werden in gemeinsamer Kontrolle zwischen SoundCloud Global Limited & Co. KG und dem jeweiligen Rechteinhaber verarbeitet, vorbehaltlich der geltenden Vereinbarung, die hier zu finden ist. Rechtliche Grundlage für die Datenverarbeitung Die Erhebung und Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten unterliegt dem für den jeweiligen für die Datenverarbeitung Verantwortlichen geltenden Recht, wie oben dargelegt. SoundCloud hält sich dabei soweit möglich an europäisches Recht und die DSGVO, um einen angemessenen Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu gewährleisten. Die Datenerhebung und -verarbeitung gemäß der DSGVO kann auf Ihrer Einwilligung (siehe Art. 6 lit. a) DSGVO), auf vertraglichen Zwecken (siehe Art. 6 lit. b) DSGVO) oder in Ausnahmefällen auf legitimen Zwecken beruhen, die wir gegen Ihre Datenschutzinteressen abwägen (siehe Art. 6 lit. f) DSGVO). Die Rechtsgrundlagen für die einzelnen Datenverarbeitungsaktivitäten haben wir im Folgenden näher erläutert. Außerdem können wir die personenbezogenen Daten unserer Nutzer gemäß DSGVO auch in folgenden Fällen verwenden: Die Verarbeitung ist zur Erfüllung einer rechtlichen Verpflichtung erforderlich, der der Verantwortliche unterliegt (siehe Art. 6 lit. c) DSGVO); Die Verarbeitung ist zum Schutz wesentlicher Interessen der betroffenen Person oder einer anderen natürlichen Person erforderlich (Art. 6 lit. d) GDPR); oder Die Verarbeitung ist zur Wahrnehmung einer Aufgabe erforderlich, die im öffentlichen Interesse liegt oder in Ausübung öffentlicher Gewalt erfolgt, die dem Verantwortlichen übertragen wurde (siehe Art. 6 lit. e) GDPR).

Umfragedaten – Wenn Sie an einer Umfrage teilnehmen, werden Sie möglicherweise bestimmte personenbezogene Daten als Teil Ihrer Antwort angeben (es sei denn, Sie antworten anonym). Die hier von Ihnen zur Verfügung gestellten personenbezogenen Daten werden nur auf der Grundlage Ihrer Zustimmung verarbeitet. Von Ihnen eingestellte Informationen – Möglicherweise übermitteln Sie personenbezogene Daten, wenn Sie Tracks auf die Plattform hochladen, wenn Sie Kommentare abgeben oder wenn Sie sich an Diskussionen in der Community beteiligen. Dies geschieht auf freiwilliger Basis, wobei wir diese Daten im Einklang mit unseren Nutzungsbedingungen für vertragliche Zwecke verwenden können. Aus steuerlichen oder finanziellen Gründen bereitgestellte Informationen Steuer-ID/Umsatzsteuernummer – Gegebenenfalls erheben wir auch Ihre Steuer-ID oder Umsatzsteuernummer. Wenn Sie sich als Unternehmen bei SoundCloud Direct anmelden, sind diese personenbezogenen Daten für eine korrekte Steuerabrechnung erforderlich. Andere Informationen zum Steuerempfänger und W9-Bescheinigungen (nur USA) – Wenn Sie in den USA ansässig sind, erheben wir bestimmte persönliche Daten und Bescheinigungen von Ihnen, die es uns ermöglichen, entsprechende Auszahlungen an die US-amerikanische Steuerbehörde (Internal Revenue Service) zu melden. Für PayPal verwendete E-Mail-Adresse – Um alle durch Ihre monetarisierten Tracks erzielten Einnahmen auf das von Ihnen angegebene PayPal-Konto überweisen zu können, benötigen wir die mit dem PayPal-Konto verbundene E-Mail-Adresse, über die Sie Ihre berechtigten Auszahlungen erhalten möchten. Automatisch erfasste personenbezogene Daten Es gibt bestimmte personenbezogene Daten, die wir automatisch als Ergebnis Ihrer Nutzung der Plattform erheben. Dies geschieht in Abhängigkeit von den von Ihnen in Ihren Einstellungen getroffenen Entscheidungen oder durch die Verwendung von Cookies und anderen Webanalysediensten, wie in unserer Cookie-Richtlinie beschrieben. Diese personenbezogenen Daten umfassen im Allgemeinen: Informationen zur Nutzung – Wir erheben personenbezogene Daten über Ihre Interaktionen mit der Plattform. Dazu gehören die von Ihnen besuchten Seiten und die von Ihnen angeklickten Links, das Streaming, Offline-Hören oder Herunterladen von Tracks, das Hochladen oder Aufnehmen von Tracks, das Verbinden Ihres Facebook-, Google- oder Apple-Kontos, das Teilen eines Tracks mit anderen Nutzern, das Folgen oder Entfolgen anderer Nutzer, das Posten eines Kommentars, das Durchführen einer Suche, der Zeitpunkt, die Häufigkeit und die Dauer Ihrer Besuche auf der Plattform und ob Sie mit E-Mail-Nachrichten interagieren (z. B. ob Sie die E-Mail-Nachricht öffnen, anklicken oder weiterleiten). Diese Nutzung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten erfolgt ausschließlich zu vertraglichen Zwecken, sofern Sie unsere Nutzungsbedingungen akzeptiert haben. Wenn Sie sich nicht bei SoundCloud registriert haben, erfolgt die Nutzung dieser personenbezogenen Daten auf Grundlage unseres berechtigten Interesses. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir solche Nutzungsdaten benötigen, da wir vertraglich zur Nachverfolgung der Nutzung von Inhalten durch unsere Inhaltsanbieter verpflichtet sind. Protokolldaten – Bei Ihrer Nutzung der Plattform erfassen wir automatisch Protokolldaten, auch wenn Sie sich nicht für ein Konto registriert oder eingeloggt haben. Zu diesen personenbezogenen Daten gehören unter anderem: Details zur Nutzung der Plattform (einschließlich Links zu Websites oder Diensten von Drittanbietern), IP-Adresse, Zugriffszeiten, Ihr Browsertyp und Betriebssystem, Geräteinformationen, Informationen zu Geräteereignissen (z. B. Abstürze und Browsertyp) und die Seite, die Sie vor oder nach der Nutzung der Plattform angesehen oder aufgerufen haben. Diese personenbezogenen Daten sind für unseren Service unerlässlich und beruhen daher entweder auf vertraglichen Zwecken oder auf einem berechtigten Interesse, sofern keine entsprechende Vereinbarung besteht. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir solche Protokolldaten benötigen, da wir vertraglich zur Nachverfolgung der Nutzung von Inhalten durch unsere Inhaltsanbieter verpflichtet sind. Cookies – Wir verwenden Cookies und andere ähnliche Technologien wie Pixel, lokale Speicherung und Identifikatoren für mobile Geräte. Außerdem können wir unseren Geschäftspartnern die Verwendung dieser Tracking-Technologien auf der Plattform gestatten oder andere beauftragen, Ihr Verhalten in unserem Namen zu verfolgen. Art, Anzahl und Funktion der Cookies können je nach Ihrer individuellen Auswahl variieren. Weitere Informationen über unsere Verwendung dieser Technologien finden Sie in unserer Cookie-Richtlinie . Standortdaten – Bei der Nutzung bestimmter Funktionen der Plattform können wir personenbezogene Daten über Ihren ungefähren Standort erfassen. Physische Standorte, die über unsere Plattform erfasst werden, werden mit nicht persönlich identifizierbaren Daten verknüpft, einschließlich, aber nicht beschränkt auf Gerätetyp, Browsertyp und Betriebssystem. Wir verwenden solche personenbezogenen Daten, um personalisierte standortbezogene Dienste oder Inhalte bereitzustellen. In einigen Fällen haben Sie die Möglichkeit, die Nutzung des Standorts Ihres Geräts zuzulassen oder zu verweigern. Wenn Sie sich jedoch gegen eine solche Nutzung entscheiden, können wir Ihnen möglicherweise nicht die entsprechenden personalisierten Dienste oder Inhalte zur Verfügung stellen. Wir verwenden diese personenbezogenen Daten, um Ihnen standortbezogene Dienste (wie z. B. Werbung und personalisierte Inhalte) anzubieten. Bei den meisten mobilen Geräten können Sie die Verwendung von Standortdiensten für Anwendungen in den Einstellungen des Geräts steuern oder deaktivieren. Eine solche Verwendung personenbezogener Daten beruht auf Ihrer Zustimmung, entweder innerhalb unserer Plattform oder auf Ihrem Gerät, auf dem Sie Ihre Zustimmung nach Aufforderung erteilt haben. Geräteinformationen – Wir erheben personenbezogene Daten von und über die von Ihnen verwendeten Geräte(n), einschließlich der Art und Weise, wie Sie mit der Plattform interagieren, sowie Informationen über das Gerät selbst, wie z. B. das Hardwaremodell, das Betriebssystem, IP-Adressen, Cookie-Informationen, Geräteeinstellungen, Informationen über den Mobilfunkanbieter, Kennungen für mobile Geräte und Werbung, installierte Anwendungen, Browsertyp, Sprache, Akkustand und Zeitzone. Anhand dieser Informationen können wir Ihre Aktivitäten identifizieren und zuordnen sowie personalisierte Inhalte und Werbung auf all Ihren Geräten bereitstellen. Eine solche Verwendung personenbezogener Daten basiert auf Ihrer Zustimmung, die Sie entweder auf unserer Plattform oder auf Ihrem Gerät erteilt haben. Software Development Kits („SDK“) – Wir können Drittanbieter einsetzen, einschließlich unserer Geschäftspartner und Dienstleister, die mobile SDKs zur Erfassung personenbezogener Daten und Informationen über die Interaktion von Mobilgeräten mit der Plattform verwenden. Ein SDK ist ein Computercode, den App-Entwickler in ihre Apps integrieren können, um die Anzeige von Werbung, die Erfassung personenbezogener Daten und die Implementierung damit verbundener Dienste und Funktionen zu ermöglichen. Wir können diese Technologie beispielsweise zur Analyse Ihrer Interaktion mit Materialien und Werbung sowie zur Bereitstellung von Analysen oder anderen Funktionen über mobile Geräte verwenden. Eine solche Nutzung erfolgt jedoch auf der Grundlage Ihrer Zustimmung. SoundCloud Widget – Andere Websites können SoundCloud-Widgets integrieren. Wenn Sie eine Website mit einem integrierten SoundCloud-Widget besuchen, können wir bestimmte personenbezogene Daten erhalten, einschließlich personenbezogener Daten über die von Ihnen besuchte Website. SoundCloud und das Widget können Sie möglicherweise erkennen, um Ihre Inhaltsbibliothek abzurufen. In einigen Fällen kann das Widget auch zur Anzeige personalisierter Inhalte verwendet werden. Wir wissen, wenn Sie mit einem Widget interagieren, und Websites mit solchen Widgets können diese Informationen ebenfalls erhalten. Eine solche Nutzung unterliegt der Datenschutzrichtlinie der Website oder App des Drittanbieters, der ein SoundCloud-Widget integriert hat. Von Drittparteien bereitgestellte personenbezogene Daten Single Sign-on – Wenn Sie sich über eine Anwendung eines Drittanbieters wie Facebook, Google oder Apple bei SoundCloud anmelden, autorisieren Sie uns zur Erfassung Ihrer Authentifizierungsdaten, wie z. B. Ihres Benutzernamens und Ihrer verschlüsselten Zugangsdaten. Dies gilt auch für andere persönliche Daten, die über das Konto des Drittanbieters verfügbar sind, einschließlich der folgenden persönlichen Daten: Facebook Connect – Wenn Sie über ein Facebook-Profil verfügen, können Sie sich auf unserer Website registrieren, um ein Benutzerkonto anzulegen. Sie können sich auch über das Social-Media-Plugin „Facebook Connect“ des sozialen Netzwerks Facebook, das von der Facebook Inc. 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA ("Facebook") betrieben wird, unter Verwendung der so genannten Single-Sign-on-Technologie registrieren. Sie erkennen die Social-Media-Plugins „Facebook Connect“ auf unserer Website an der blauen Schaltfläche mit dem Facebook-Logo und der Aufschrift „Weiter mit Facebook“. Wenn Sie eine Seite unseres Internetauftritts mit einem Social-Media-Plugin aufrufen, baut Ihr Browser eine direkte Verbindung mit den Servern von Facebook auf. Der Inhalt des Plugins wird von Facebook direkt an Ihren Browser übermittelt und von diesem in die Webseite eingebettet. Durch das integrierte Plugin erhält Facebook die Information, dass Ihr Browser die entsprechende Seite unseres Webauftritts aufgerufen hat. Dies gilt auch dann, wenn Sie kein Facebook-Profil besitzen oder gerade nicht bei Facebook eingeloggt sind. Diese Information (einschließlich Ihrer IP-Adresse) wird von Ihrem Browser direkt an einen Server von Facebook in den USA übermittelt und dort gespeichert. Diese Datenverarbeitung erfolgt auf der Grundlage des berechtigten Interesses von Facebook an der Einblendung von personalisierter Werbung auf Basis des Surfverhaltens. Über den „Facebook Connect“-Button auf unserer Website können Sie sich auch mit Ihren Facebook-Nutzerdaten auf unserer Website anmelden oder registrieren. Abhängig von Ihren persönlichen Datenschutzeinstellungen bei Facebook erhalten wir bei der Nutzung des „Facebook-Connect“-Buttons nur dann allgemeine, öffentlich zugängliche und in Ihrem Profil gespeicherte Informationen, wenn Sie vor dem Anmeldevorgang durch einen entsprechenden Hinweis auf den Datenaustausch mit Facebook Ihre ausdrückliche Einwilligung erteilen. Zu diesen Informationen gehören Ihre Benutzerkennung, Ihr Name, Ihr Profilbild, Ihr Alter und Ihr Geschlecht. Wir weisen darauf hin, dass mit Ihrer Zustimmung oder bei Änderungen der Datenschutzbestimmungen und Nutzungsbedingungen von Facebook Ihre Profilbilder, die Benutzerkennungen Ihrer Freunde und die Freundesliste übertragen werden können, sofern diese Daten in Ihren Privatsphären-Einstellungen als „öffentlich“ markiert sind. Neben der Verknüpfung Ihres Facebook-Kontos mit Ihrem SoundCloud-Konto zum Zwecke der Registrierung und Anmeldung können Sie auf freiwilliger Basis (d. h. mit Ihrer ausdrücklichen Zustimmung) weitere personenbezogene Daten aus Ihrem Facebook-Profil mit Facebook Connect zur Verfügung stellen, um Ihre Nutzung unserer Plattform zu bereichern. Dies gilt insbesondere für Ihre Likes und/oder Ihr Nutzungs-, Hör- und Sehverhalten sowie Ihre Freunde innerhalb von Facebook. Falls Sie sich für die Weitergabe dieser Informationen an uns entscheiden, werden wir Ihnen relevante Künstler, Playlists und dergleichen anzeigen, die Ihnen gefallen könnten. Die von Facebook übermittelten personenbezogenen Daten werden von uns gespeichert und verarbeitet, um ein Benutzerkonto mit den erforderlichen personenbezogenen Daten zu erstellen, sofern Sie dies auf Facebook genehmigt haben. Umgekehrt können aufgrund Ihrer Einwilligung personenbezogene Daten (z. B. über Ihr Surf- oder Kaufverhalten) von uns an Ihr Facebook-Profil übermittelt werden. Zweck und Umfang der Datenerhebung und die weitere Verarbeitung und Nutzung der Daten durch Facebook sowie Ihre diesbezüglichen Rechte und Einstellungsmöglichkeiten zum Schutz Ihrer Privatsphäre entnehmen Sie bitte den Datenschutzhinweisen von Facebook . Wenn Sie nicht möchten, dass Facebook die über unseren Internetauftritt gesammelten Daten Ihrem Facebook-Profil zuordnet, müssen Sie sich vor Ihrem Besuch unseres Internetauftritts bei Facebook ausloggen. Sie können das Laden des Facebook-Plugins auch mit Add-ons für Ihren Browser komplett verhindern. Google – Sie können sich bei SoundCloud auch mit Ihrem Google-Konto anmelden und einloggen. In diesem Fall bittet Google Sie um Ihre Erlaubnis, bestimmte Informationen aus Ihrem Google-Konto mit SoundCloud zu teilen. Dazu gehören Ihre Google-E-Mail-Adresse, Ihr Geburtsdatum (optional), Ihr Geschlecht (optional) und Ihr Avatar (optional). Diese Informationen werden von Google erfasst und uns unter den Bedingungen der Google-Datenschutzbestimmungen zur Verfügung gestellt. Die von Google an uns übermittelten Informationen können Sie über Ihre Google-Aktivitätskontrollen steuern. Wenn Sie sich versehentlich über Google angemeldet haben, können Sie Ihr Konto jederzeit auf der Seite „Konto“ in Ihren Einstellungen löschen. Alternativ können Sie uns auch über das Help Center kontaktieren. Apple – Sie können sich bei SoundCloud auch mit Ihrer Apple-ID anmelden und einloggen. In diesem Fall bittet Sie Apple um Ihre Erlaubnis, bestimmte Informationen aus Ihrem Apple-Konto mit SoundCloud zu teilen. Dazu gehören Ihre Apple-E-Mail-Adresse, Ihr Geburtsdatum (optional), Ihr Geschlecht (optional) und Ihr Avatar (optional). Diese Informationen werden von Apple erfasst und uns unter den Bedingungen der Apple-Datenschutzbestimmungen zur Verfügung gestellt. Die von Apple an uns übermittelten Informationen können Sie über die Apple-ID-Einstellungen steuern. Wenn Sie sich versehentlich über Apple angemeldet haben, können Sie Ihr Konto jederzeit auf der Seite „Konto“ in Ihren Einstellungen löschen. Alternativ können Sie uns auch über das Help Center kontaktieren. Dienstanbieter und Geschäftspartner – Wir können auch von unseren Dienstleistern und Geschäftspartnern personenbezogene Daten über Sie erhalten. Dazu gehören Unternehmen, die uns bei der Zahlungsabwicklung, der Analyse, der Werbung, dem Marketing, der Datenverarbeitung und -verwaltung (z. B. zur Messung der Anzeigenqualität und der Reaktionen auf Anzeigen und zur Schaltung von Anzeigen mit erhöhter Relevanz für Sie, auch für SoundCloud-Produkte), der Kontoverwaltung, dem Hosting, dem Kunden- und technischen Support, der Moderation von Inhalten und anderen Diensten unterstützen, die wir zur Personalisierung Ihrer SoundCloud-Erfahrung nutzen. Warum und wie wir diese personenbezogenen Daten verwenden, wird im Folgenden näher erläutert. Android IDs – Wir erfassen Ihre Google Android-Werbe-ID („AAID“). Sie können diese Nummern über die Einstellungen des Betriebssystems Ihres Geräts zurücksetzen (wir kontrollieren dies nicht). Diese Kennungen werden nur mit Ihrer Zustimmung für weitere Analysen verwendet. Apple IDs – Wir erfassen Ihre Apple Identifier for Advertising („IDFA“). Sie können diese Nummern über die Einstellungen des Betriebssystems Ihres Geräts zurücksetzen (wir kontrollieren dies nicht). Diese Kennungen werden nur mit Ihrer Zustimmung für weitere Analysen verwendet. App-übergreifendes Tracking auf Apple-Geräten – Seit iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5 und tvOS 14.5 müssen wir über das AppTrackingTransparency-Framework Ihre Einwilligung einholen, um über die Werbekennung Ihres Geräts ein Tracking von Ihnen und Ihrer Daten durchzuführen (siehe oben „IDFA“). Tracking bezieht sich auf die Verknüpfung von in unserer App erhobenen Nutzer- oder Gerätedaten mit Nutzer- oder Gerätedaten, die von Apps, Websites oder Offline-Einrichtungen anderer Unternehmen zu Zwecken der gezielten Werbung oder Werbemessung erhoben wurden. Der Begriff Tracking bezieht sich außerdem auf die Weitergabe von Benutzer- oder Gerätedaten an Datenmakler. Die Nutzung eines solchen Trackings unterliegt Ihrer Zustimmung und kann daher nur mit dieser Zustimmung von uns ausgeübt werden. Apple erlaubt die Verwendung der ID for Vendors (IDFV) zu Analysezwecken für Apps desselben Inhaltsanbieters (uns). Die IDFV darf nicht mit anderen Daten kombiniert werden, um einen Nutzer über Apps und Websites anderer Unternehmen hinweg zu verfolgen, es sei denn, Sie haben uns die Erlaubnis dazu erteilt. Weitere Informationen darüber, wie wir das SKAdNetwork für das Attributions-Tracking nutzen, finden Sie in der Dokumentation, die Apple hier bereitstellt Informationen zur Zahlungsverifizierung – Wir nutzen die Dienste von Adyen (Adyen N.V., Simon Carmiggeltstraat 6-50, 1011 DJ, Niederlande, zu den Datenschutzbestimmungen ), Recurly (Recurly, Inc., San Francisco, CA (HQ), 400 Alabama Street, Suite 202 San Francisco, CA 94110, Vereinigte Staaten, zu den Datenschutzbestimmungen ) und Apple Pay (nur über In-App-Käufe und vorbehaltlich der Datenschutzbestimmungen von Apple, Inc. und der Geschäftsbedingungen des Zahlungsanbieters, mit dem Sie Apple Pay nutzen) für die Verarbeitung Ihrer Zahlungen. Wir erhalten eine Verifizierung, die Informationen über die jeweilige Zahlungsmethode und Ihren Namen sowie andere nicht persönlich identifizierbare Zahlungsinformationen (z. B. das Ablaufdatum einer Kreditkarte) sowie vom jeweiligen Zahlungsanbieter gehashte Informationen (z. B. eine gehashte Kreditkartennummer) enthält. Zahlungsabwicklung im Apple App Store und Google Play Store – Dienste zur Zahlungsabwicklung innerhalb der jeweiligen Apps und App Stores ermöglichen SoundCloud die Abwicklung von Zahlungen. Dabei verarbeitet oder speichert SoundCloud keine Kreditkartendaten und verwendet nur die Informationen, die für die Durchführung der Transaktion mit den Finanzvermittlern, welche die Transaktion abwickeln, erforderlich sind. Auch wenn wir niemals Zugang zu den unverschlüsselten Kartendaten eines Karteninhabers haben, können einige dieser Dienste auch den Versand von zeitlich begrenzten Nachrichten an Sie ermöglichen, wie z. B. E-Mails mit Rechnungen oder Benachrichtigungen über Ihre Zahlung. Externe Zahlungsanbieter – Der von Ihnen für die Zahlung verwendete Zahlungsanbieter ist allein für die Zahlung verantwortlich. Weitere Informationen finden Sie in den Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen und den Datenschutzrichtlinien Ihres Zahlungsanbieters.

Wir tun dies mit Hilfe von automatisierten Systemen und Entscheidungsprozessen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir, wenn wir uns auf automatisierte Entscheidungsprozesse beziehen, kein Profiling durchführen, das rechtliche Auswirkungen auf Sie hat oder Sie in ähnlicher Weise erheblich beeinträchtigen würde.

Bereitstellung von zielgerichtetem Marketing für SoundCloud-Produkte auf und außerhalb der Plattform und Erfolgsmessung für diese Kampagnen. Wenn Sie unsere Werbeanzeigen auf Websites oder Apps von Drittanbietern sehen, können wir oder die Drittanbieterdienste, mit denen wir zu diesem Zweck zusammenarbeiten, personenbezogene Daten erfassen. Zu diesen personenbezogenen Daten gehören die Informationen, die Ihr Browser oder Ihre mobile App beim Anzeigen der Werbung zur Verfügung stellt (z. B. IP-Adresse, Referral URL, Browserdetails, Zeitstempel der Anfrage), zum Beispiel, wenn ein Klick auf unsere Werbeanzeige zu einem tatsächlichen Abschluss eines Abonnements geführt hat. Hilfe bei der Auswahl der Anzeigen, die Ihnen im Auftrag von Werbetreibenden gezeigt werden. Denn Anzeigen sind effektiver, wenn sie Personen gezeigt werden, die sich mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit für das beworbene Produkt oder die Dienstleistung interessieren. Dazu gehören personenbezogene Daten, die Sie uns freiwillig zur Verfügung stellen (z. B. Alter und Geschlecht) und die Sie uns im Rahmen der Interaktion mit der Plattform zur Verfügung stellen (z. B. durch Hören, Liken oder Erstellen von Wiedergabelisten), sowie Geräteinformationen und allgemeine Standortdaten. Außerdem können wir Anzeigen einblenden, die auf der von Ihnen besuchten Seite oder auf Materialien basieren, die Sie kürzlich angesehen, gesucht oder angehört haben. Auf diese Weise können wir Ihnen Werbung zeigen, die für Sie relevanter und interessanter sein dürfte. Erhebung bestimmter personenbezogener Daten wie Cookie-Daten und Geräteinformationen im Falle der Zusammenarbeit mit Drittanbietern wie Werbenetzwerken und Ad Exchanges, die es uns ermöglichen, Ihnen auf Sie zugeschnittene Werbung zu zeigen. Diese personenbezogenen Daten werden verwendet, um Nutzer mit Segmenten zu synchronisieren oder abzugleichen und zielgerichtete Werbung auszuspielen, die auf Geräteaktivitäten, abgeleiteten Interessen und allgemeinen Standortinformationen basiert.

Sie erhalten dann eine E-Mail, in der Sie das Abonnement des Newsletters bestätigen müssen (Double-Opt-in). Wenn Sie Ihr Newsletter-Abonnement nicht innerhalb von 72 Stunden bestätigen, verfällt es automatisch und die personenbezogenen Daten werden nicht für den Versand des Newsletters verarbeitet. Der Versand des Newsletters erfolgt direkt über unser eigenes System (Braze), wobei Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht an Dritte oder Auftragsverarbeiter weitergegeben werden. Sollten Sie Ihr Abonnement nicht innerhalb von 72 Stunden bestätigen, löschen wir die von Ihnen angegebenen personenbezogenen Daten. Nach erfolgreicher Bestätigung speichern wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten bis zum Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung (Abmeldung vom Newsletter) und aus technischen Gründen darüber hinaus für maximal 21 Tage. Diese Verarbeitung erfolgt auf der Grundlage Ihrer Einwilligung. Mit der Abmeldung vom Newsletter können Sie Ihre Einwilligung jederzeit widerrufen. Marktforschungsstudien – Auf der Grundlage unseres berechtigten Interesses werden wir Sie von Zeit zu Zeit um die Teilnahme an Marktforschungsstudien und Umfragen bitten oder Forschungsstudien auf der Grundlage von anonymisierten und/oder pseudonymisierten Daten durchführen. Es besteht jedoch keinerlei Verpflichtung zur Teilnahme an unseren Studien. Falls Sie teilnehmen, geschieht dies auf der Grundlage Ihrer Einwilligung, die Sie bei der Beantwortung der Umfrage geben. Die Verwendung anonymisierter und/oder pseudonymisierter Daten ist nach unserer Auffassung durch unser berechtigtes Interesse gedeckt, da wir solche Analysen nur zur weiteren Verbesserung unserer Forschung und unserer Plattform verwenden, um Ihre Bedürfnisse zu verstehen und Ihr Benutzererlebnis zu optimieren. Wir werden die von Ihnen im Rahmen der Beantwortung der Marktstudie zur Verfügung gestellten Daten nur für andere Zwecke verwenden (z. B. für maßgeschneiderte Produktempfehlungen oder Benachrichtigungen), die auf Ihrer Einwilligung beruhen, die Sie vor Ihrer Teilnahme an der Marktstudie erteilt haben. Betrieb und Unterhaltung der Monetarisierung von SoundCloud Direct – Falls Sie die Dienste von SoundCloud Direct nutzen, verwenden wir die von Ihnen bereitgestellten personenbezogenen Daten, um Ihre Monetarisierung und/oder Ihren Vertrieb mit SoundCloud Direct zu betreiben und zu unterhalten. Die personenbezogenen Daten werden verwendet, um die auszahlungsfähigen Einnahmen an Sie zu berechnen und die Zahlungen auf Ihr PayPal-Konto oder an einen anderen akzeptierten Zahlungsanbieter zu veranlassen. Wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten weitergeben In diesem Abschnitt wird beschrieben, wie die durch Ihre Nutzung der Plattform erfassten oder generierten personenbezogenen Daten von Ihnen oder von uns weitergegeben werden können. Über Ihr Profil – Alle personenbezogenen Daten in Ihrem öffentlichen Profil (mit Ausnahme Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse) sind für andere Nutzer der Plattform zugänglich, die Ihre Profilinformationen einsehen, Ihre öffentlichen Tracks anhören und kommentieren, sich selbst zu Ihrer Follower-Liste hinzufügen und Ihnen Nachrichten senden können. Die Inhaber von Künstlerprofilen können in ihren Statistiken sehen, dass Sie die von ihnen hochgeladenen Tracks angehört haben, sowie eine Rangliste derjenigen, die ihre Tracks am häufigsten angehört haben. Sie können auch sehen, wie oft Sie sich einen ihrer Tracks angehört haben und dass Sie Ihnen folgen. Auf diese Weise können die Urheber die Beliebtheit ihrer Tracks verfolgen. Wenn Sie einen Track auf der Plattform kommentieren, sind Ihre Kommentare zusammen mit Ihrem Profilnamen und Ihrem Bild für alle Nutzer der Plattform sichtbar. Weitere Informationen finden Sie im Dokument SoundCloud Fan Insights hier . Dienstleister – Wir setzen eine Reihe von Dienstleistern ein, von denen sich einige außerhalb des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums („EWR“) befinden können, um in unserem Auftrag Dienstleistungen für uns oder unsere Nutzer zu erbringen. Diese Dienstleister haben nur dann Zugang zu Ihren personenbezogenen Daten, wenn sie diese Aufgaben in unserem Auftrag ausführen. Sie sind vertraglich verpflichtet, angemessene organisatorische und technische Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zu ergreifen, um eine unbefugte Offenlegung personenbezogener Daten zu verhindern, und personenbezogene Daten nur gemäß unseren Anweisungen und in dem Umfang zu verarbeiten, der für die Erbringung ihrer Dienstleistungen für uns erforderlich ist. Wir müssen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten weitergeben, um die angemessene Erfüllung unserer vertraglichen Verpflichtungen mit Ihnen zu gewährleisten. So arbeiten wir z. B. eng mit Dienstleistern im Bereich Kundenservice (z. B. Help Center, Content-Moderation), mit technischen Dienstleistern (z. B. Betrieb von Rechenzentren) oder Musikdienstleistern (z. B. Rechteverwaltung) und Zahlungsdienstleistern zusammen. Diese Dienstleister dürfen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten in der Regel nur unter besonderen Bedingungen in unserem Auftrag verarbeiten. Bei der Inanspruchnahme solcher Dienstleister gewährleisten wir ein angemessenes Datenschutzniveau und werden alle vertraglichen und tatsächlichen Schutzmaßnahmen ergreifen, um die entsprechenden Vorschriften (wie die DSGVO, Standardvertragsklauseln oder den CCPA) einzuhalten. Rechteinhaber – Über die Plattform können Sie eine Vielzahl von Tracks wie unter anderem lizenzierte Streaming-Inhalte anhören. Wir teilen personenbezogene Daten mit den Rechteinhabern, die uns Tracks lizenzieren. Dadurch können sie besser verstehen, wie die von ihnen bereitgestellten Tracks angenommen werden, und gewinnen Erkenntnisse über allgemeine oder individuelle Hörtrends und Vorlieben der Nutzer – dies kann sowohl Ihre öffentlichen Profildaten als auch grundlegende Nutzungsdaten (z. B. Interaktionen mit Tracks) umfassen. Wir geben diese personenbezogenen Daten auf der Grundlage unseres berechtigten Interesses weiter, da unsere Verträge mit diesen Rechteinhabern vorsehen, dass ihnen diese Einblicke gewährt werden. Deren Interesse hat Vorrang vor Ihrem berechtigten Interesse an der Geheimhaltung Ihrer öffentlichen Profilinformationen und grundlegenden Nutzungsdaten. Verwertungsgesellschaften – Aufgrund gesetzlicher Verpflichtungen sind wir in vielen Ländern der Welt verpflichtet, pseudonymisierte oder anonymisierte Nutzungsdaten an Verwertungsgesellschaften zu übermitteln. Werbung – Wir geben die über Sie gesammelten personenbezogenen Daten in gehashter, aggregierter oder pseudonymisierter Form an Werbetreibende, Werbedienstleister und Geschäftspartner weiter, um Werbung auf der Grundlage der Interessen der jeweiligen Segmente zu schalten und die Reichweite und Effektivität dieser Werbung zu messen. Dies umfasst unter anderem die Frage, ob ein Nutzer eine bestimmte Aktion durchgeführt hat (z. B. Kauf eines Produkts). Zudem können wir Cookie-Daten und Gerätekennungen mit Dienstanbietern zum Zweck des Datenabgleichs austauschen, um das Anzeigen-Targeting zu verbessern. Eine detaillierte Übersicht über unsere Werbepartner finden Sie hier . Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten, sofern diese identifizierbar sind, nur mit Ihrer Zustimmung verwenden. Social Media – Für Nutzer außerhalb der EU/des EWR und soweit nach geltendem Recht zulässig, können wir Ihre E-Mail-Adresse (in gehashter Form, sodass Sie nicht identifiziert werden können) an Meta weitergeben. So können wir Ihnen gezielt Werbung für SoundCloud-Produkte auf Facebook und auf Websites und Anwendungen Dritter im Meta Audience Network präsentieren. Für Nutzer innerhalb der EU/EWR ist dies nur mit Ihrer ausdrücklichen Zustimmung zulässig. Wir erlauben Facebook und anderen Social-Media-Plattformen zudem, personenbezogene Daten über Cookies und ähnliche Technologien wie Pixel zu erfassen, um Anzeigen für SoundCloud auf diesen Websites und Anwendungen Dritter zu schalten und Nutzer auf unsere Plattform zu führen. Um die Effektivität dieser Marketingkampagnen zu messen und zu optimieren, verfolgen diese Technologien die Aktivitäten auf verschiedenen Geräten nachdem ein Nutzer eine SoundCloud-Anzeige gesehen hat. So können Leistungskennzahlen wie Anmeldungen, Besuche auf der Plattform und Käufe ermittelt werden. Fragen dazu, wie diese Anbieter von Social-Media-Plattformen Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verarbeiten, sollten an diese Anbieter gerichtet werden. Aggregierte Daten – Wir können außerdem aggregierte und anonymisierte personenbezogene Daten (personenbezogene Daten über unsere Nutzer, die wir so aufbereiten, dass sie einen einzelnen Nutzer nicht mehr identifizieren oder referenzieren) und andere pseudonymisierte personenbezogene Daten für die Einhaltung gesetzlicher Anforderungen, Branchen- und Marktanalysen, demografische Profilerstellung, Marketing und Werbung sowie andere Geschäftszwecke weitergeben. API-Integrationen – SoundCloud verfügt über eine offene Schnittstelle zur Anwendungsprogrammierung (API), über die Entwickler von Anwendungen Elemente der Plattform in andere Anwendungen integrieren können. Einige dieser Entwickler können außerhalb des EWR ansässig sein. Sie werden jedoch immer, wenn Nutzerdaten betroffen sind, einen Datenverarbeitungszusatz und dementsprechend (falls zutreffend) EU-US-Standardvertragsklauseln unterzeichnen. Alle personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie auf der Plattform veröffentlichen, einschließlich Ihrer öffentlichen Profilinformationen und aller öffentlichen Tracks, können für diese Entwickler zugänglich sein und unterliegen unseren API-Nutzungsbedingungen . Bitte bedenken Sie dies bei der Entscheidung, welche Informationen Sie in Ihrem Profil veröffentlichen möchten. Informationen darüber, wie Sie die über die API verfügbaren Informationen einschränken können, finden Sie weiter unten im Abschnitt „Ihre Auswahl- und Kontrollmöglichkeiten“. Anwendungen von Drittanbietern – Wenn Sie sich für die Verbindung Ihres SoundCloud-Kontos mit anderen Apps oder sozialen Netzwerken wie Facebook entscheiden, können Sie bestimmte personenbezogene Daten mit diesen Apps oder Netzwerken teilen. Materialien, die Sie mit sozialen Netzwerken teilen, erscheinen auf Ihrer Timeline (oder ähnlichen Funktionen) sowie in Newsfeeds, die von der Öffentlichkeit oder von bestimmten Followern eingesehen werden können, vorbehaltlich der Geschäftsbedingungen dieser sozialen Netzwerke. Bei verbundenen Apps müssen Sie dem App-Entwickler vollen Zugriff auf Ihr SoundCloud-Konto gewähren, um Tracks hoch- und herunterzuladen oder um Tracks innerhalb der App zu kommentieren, als Favoriten zu markieren oder weiterzuleiten. Dies bedeutet, dass Sie Ihre öffentlichen Informationen sowie den Zugriff auf Ihre privaten Tracks freigeben müssen. SoundCloud ist nicht für diese anderen Apps oder Netzwerke verantwortlich. Bitte stellen Sie daher sicher, dass Sie Ihr Konto nur mit Apps oder Diensten verbinden, denen Sie vertrauen. Informationen darüber, wie Sie die von Ihnen freigegebenen persönlichen Daten kontrollieren und wie Sie Ihr Konto wieder von diesen Apps trennen können, finden Sie weiter unten im Abschnitt „Ihre Auswahl- und Kontrollmöglichkeiten“. Wenn Sie nicht möchten, dass diese Informationen mit solchen sozialen Netzwerken oder anderen Anwendungen von Drittanbietern geteilt werden, ändern Sie bitte Ihre SoundCloud-Einstellungen auf unserer Plattform oder in diesen Netzwerken. Verwendung Ihres Namens und anderer Benutzerkennungen bei der Weitergabe von Links – Bei der Weitergabe personenbezogener Daten von unserer Plattform auf anderen Plattformen, insbesondere auf Social Media Plattformen wie Facebook oder Instagram, können wir Ihre pseudonymisierten Daten verwenden. Wenn ein Nutzer auf Ihren weitergegebenen Link klickt und zu unserer Plattform weitergeleitet wird, wird dem Nutzer ein Banner mit dem Hinweis angezeigt, dass Sie SoundCloud nutzen und/oder dass Sie diesen Link geteilt haben (in diesem Zusammenhang wird Ihr Profilname angezeigt). Der Nutzer wird dann gefragt, ob er Ihnen folgen möchte. Eine solche Nutzung durch uns wird als berechtigtes Interesse angesehen, da sie unser Nutzererlebnis und die Art und Weise, wie unsere Nutzer miteinander in Kontakt treten, bereichert. Da wir davon ausgehen, dass Sie Links verantwortungsbewusst mit Personen teilen, mit denen Sie interagieren möchten, gehen wir auch davon aus, dass Ihr Interesse an der sicheren Aufbewahrung Ihrer persönlichen Daten nicht beeinträchtigt wird – zumal wir nur pseudonymisierte Daten innerhalb des Links selbst verwenden. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Ihr geteilter Link von anderen Parteien weitergegeben werden kann. Einhaltung von Gesetzen – Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Gerichte, Strafverfolgungsbehörden und Regierungsbehörden weitergeben, (i) um unseren rechtlichen Verpflichtungen nachzukommen, (ii) um rechtlichen Verfahren nachzukommen und um auf Ansprüche zu reagieren, die gegen SoundCloud geltend gemacht werden, (iii) um auf bestätigte Anfragen im Zusammenhang mit strafrechtlichen Ermittlungen oder angeblichen oder vermuteten illegalen Aktivitäten oder anderen Aktivitäten zu reagieren, die uns oder andere Nutzer einer rechtlichen Haftung aussetzen könnten, (iv) um unsere Nutzungsbedingungen und andere Vereinbarungen mit Nutzern durchzusetzen und zu verwalten oder (v) um die Rechte, das Eigentum oder die persönliche Sicherheit von SoundCloud, seinen Mitarbeitern und Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit zu schützen. Schutz unserer Rechte – Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten offenlegen, wenn wir dies zum Schutz oder zur Verteidigung unserer legitimen Rechte und Interessen oder der Rechte und Interessen unserer Nutzer, Mitarbeiter, Direktoren, leitenden Angestellten oder Aktionäre für erforderlich halten und/oder um die Sicherheit der Plattform und/oder der SoundCloud-Community zu gewährleisten. Kontrollwechsel – Wir können Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auch im Rahmen eines Verkaufs, einer Fusion oder einer Änderung der Kontrolle über SoundCloud oder in Vorbereitung auf eines dieser Ereignisse weitergeben. Jedes andere Unternehmen, das uns oder einen Teil unseres Unternehmens kauft, hat das Recht, Ihre personenbezogenen Daten weiterhin zu verwenden, jedoch nur in der in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschriebenen Weise. Gezielte Kommunikation und Werbung – Hier finden Sie eine Liste externer Werbepartner , mit denen wir zusammenarbeiten und an die wir personenbezogene Daten (oft in aggregierter oder anonymisierter Form) zu Analysezwecken, für zielgerichtete Kommunikation und Werbung weitergeben, sofern Sie dem zugestimmt haben und diese Option in Ihren Einstellungen nicht deaktiviert haben. Eine solche Einwilligung wird über unser Tool zur Cookie-Einwilligung oder über Ihre Einstellungen in Ihrem Konto eingeholt. SoundCloud Direct – Wenn Sie anderen Nutzern Zugang zu Ihrem SoundCloud Direct-Konto gewähren oder wenn Sie unsere „Split Pay“-Funktion einrichten, sind einige personenbezogene Daten (wie Ihr Name und Ihre E-Mail-Adresse) für diese Nutzer verfügbar. Wenn Sie den SC Planner verwenden, ist Ihr SC Planner-Profil außerdem für andere Nutzer im Bereich „Leaderboard“ der App sichtbar, es sei denn, Sie haben Ihr Profil in Ihren Einstellungen unsichtbar gemacht. Cookies und ähnliche Technologien Wie in unserer Cookie-Richtlinie beschrieben, verwenden wir Cookies und ähnliche Technologien (z. B. Pixel, lokale Speicherung und Gerätekennungen), um Sie und/oder Ihr(e) Gerät(e) auf der Plattform und außerhalb der Plattform sowie geräteübergreifend zu identifizieren. Soweit Ihre Einstellungen oder Ihr Gerät dies zulassen, gestatten wir auch Dritten die Verwendung von Cookies, wie in unserer Cookie-Richtlinie beschrieben, um das Nutzerverhalten auf der Plattform und außerhalb der Plattform zu verfolgen. So können wir Ihnen Werbung zeigen, die auf Ihren Interessen und Vorlieben basiert. Sie können Cookies über Ihren Browser und andere Tools steuern, wie in der Cookie-Richtlinie beschrieben. Bitte beachten Sie, dass die Verwendung von Cookies Ihrer Zustimmung bedarf. Hiervon ausgenommen sind die technische Speicherung oder der Zugriff zur Übermittlung von Mitteilungen oder die Bereitstellung eines Dienstes, der von einem Nutzer ausdrücklich angefordert wurde. Informationen über die Verwendung von Cookies von bestimmten Drittanbietern finden Sie bei der Auswahl der zuzulassenden Cookies innerhalb unseres Tools zur Cookie-Einwilligung. Weitere Informationen finden Sie in Ihren Kontoeinstellungen unter „Werbung“, wo Sie auch Ihre Auswahl nach der ersten Entscheidung umstellen können. Informationssicherheit SoundCloud unterhält angemessene technische, verwaltungstechnische und physische Sicherheitsvorkehrungen, die den unbefugten Zugriff auf die von uns erhobenen oder gespeicherten personenbezogenen Daten sowie deren Verwendung oder Weitergabe verhindern. Sie gewährleisten ein Sicherheitsniveau, das in Bezug auf die Rechte und Freiheiten natürlicher Personen, die von unseren Verarbeitungsvorgängen betroffen sein können, angemessen ist. Wir knotrollieren unsere Systeme regelmäßig auf mögliche Schwachstellen und Angriffe. Allerdings ist es nicht möglich, die Sicherheit der über das Internet übermittelten personenbezogenen Daten zu garantieren. Die Nutzung der Plattform und die Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten an uns erfolgt auf eigene Verantwortung und eigenes Risiko. Internationale Datenübertragungen SoundCloud ist ein weltweit tätiges Unternehmen und kann Ihre personenbezogenen Daten intern innerhalb der SoundCloud-Gruppe und an Dritte zu den in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschriebenen Zwecken weitergeben. Innerhalb des EWR erhobene personenbezogene Daten können beispielsweise zu den in dieser Datenschutzrichtlinie beschriebenen Zwecken in Länder außerhalb des EWR übertragen werden. Zur Sicherstellung der rechtmäßigen Übermittlung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten in Länder außerhalb des EWR verwenden wir geeignete Schutzmaßnahmen, wie z. B. von der Europäischen Kommission genehmigte Standardvertragsklauseln oder andere gesetzlich genehmigte Mechanismen. Diese Standardvertragsklauseln können jederzeit hier eingesehen werden. Alternativ können Sie diese Dokumente auch über die unten angegebenen Kontaktdaten direkt bei uns anfordern. Kinder SoundCloud ist nicht zur Nutzung durch Kinder bestimmt. Personen unter 16 Jahren im EWR und im Vereinigten Königreich bzw. unter 13 Jahren in den Vereinigten Staaten und dem Rest der Welt dürfen die Plattform nicht nutzen und nicht versuchen, ein Konto zu registrieren oder persönliche Daten an uns zu übermitteln. Von Personen, die jünger als 16 bzw. 13 Jahre sind, erheben wir wissentlich keine personenbezogenen Daten und gestatten ihnen auch nicht die Registrierung eines Kontos. Sollte uns bekannt werden, dass wir personenbezogene Daten von einer Person unter 16 bzw. 13 Jahren erhoben haben, werden wir diese personenbezogenen Daten so schnell wie möglich löschen. Wenn Sie Grund zu der Annahme haben, dass wir solche personenbezogenen Daten erhoben haben, informieren Sie uns bitte unverzüglich unter dataprotection@soundcloud.com . Unsere Social-Media-Aktivitäten Damit wir mit Ihnen in den sozialen Netzwerken von Drittanbietern kommunizieren und Sie über unsere Dienstleistungen informieren können, betreiben wir Seiten in den sozialen Netzwerken von Drittanbietern. Wenn Sie unsere Seiten auf einer dieser Social-Media-Präsenzen besuchen, sind wir und der Anbieter des Social-Media-Netzwerks gemeinsam für die dadurch ausgelösten Verarbeitungsvorgänge, die personenbezogene Daten betreffen, verantwortlich. Wir sind nicht der ursprüngliche Anbieter dieser Seiten, sondern nutzen diese nur im Rahmen der Möglichkeiten, die uns die jeweiligen Anbieter bieten. Für unsere in der EU bzw. im EWR ansässigen Nutzer möchten wir darauf hinweisen, dass Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auch außerhalb der EU bzw. des EWR verarbeitet werden können. Die Nutzung dieser Netzwerke kann daher für Sie mit Datenschutzrisiken verbunden sein, da der Schutz Ihrer Rechte, z. B. Ihr Recht auf Auskunft, Löschung, Widerspruch usw. gegebenenfalls erschwert ist. Die Verarbeitung in sozialen Netzwerken erfolgt häufig direkt zu Werbezwecken oder zur Analyse des Nutzerverhaltens durch die Netzwerkbetreiber, worauf wir keinen Einfluss haben. Wenn der Anbieter Nutzerprofile erstellt, werden häufig Cookies eingesetzt. Auch kann das Nutzerverhalten direkt Ihrem eigenen Mitgliedsprofil im jeweiligen sozialen Netzwerk zugeordnet werden (wenn Sie eingeloggt sind). Die geschilderte Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten erfolgt auf der Grundlage unserer berechtigten Interessen und der berechtigten Interessen des jeweiligen Anbieters, um mit Ihnen zeitnah zu kommunizieren oder Sie über unsere Leistungen zu informieren. Wenn Sie als Nutzer von den jeweiligen Anbietern um Ihre Einwilligung zur Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten gebeten werden, ist Ihre Einwilligung die Rechtsgrundlage für diese Verarbeitung. Wir haben keinen Zugriff auf die Datenbanken dieser Anbieter und möchten Sie daher darauf hinweisen, dass Sie Ihre Rechte (z. B. auf Auskunft, Berichtigung, Löschung etc.) am besten direkt bei dem jeweiligen Anbieter wahrnehmen können.

Verwaltung der SoundCloud-Einstellungen – Wenn Sie ein Konto registrieren, können Sie die Inhalte und personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie bei der Nutzung von SoundCloud freigeben, über Ihre Kontoeinstellungen verwalten, einschließlich der unten erläuterten Funktionen. Sie sind selbst für die Pflege und Aktualisierung Ihrer Einstellungen verantwortlich. E-Mail- und Gerätebenachrichtigungen – Sie können Ihre Einstellungen auf der Registerkarte „Benachrichtigung“ anpassen, um E-Mail- und Gerätebenachrichtigungen zu deaktivieren (mit Ausnahme von wichtigen Service-Updates und wesentlichen Benachrichtigungen über die Plattform oder Ihr Konto). Außerdem können Sie alle werblichen E-Mails und Newsletter jederzeit abbestellen.

Marketing – Wenn Sie keine personalisierte Werbung, Angebote oder andere Marketingnachrichten für SoundCloud-Produkte oder -Dienstleistungen erhalten möchten, können Sie Ihre Einstellungen auf der Registerkarte „Datenschutz“ anpassen (wählen Sie die Option „Kommunikation“ in Ihrem „Cookie-Manager“). Werbung – Wenn Sie nicht möchten, dass Ihnen SoundCloud „interessenbasierte“ oder personalisierte Anzeigen für Produkte von Dritten anzeigt, können Sie Ihre Einstellungen in der Registerkarte „Werbung“ anpassen. Bitte beachten Sie jedoch, dass Sie auch bei Ablehnung von personalisierter Werbung weiterhin Werbung angezeigt bekommen können, die jedoch wahrscheinlich nicht so relevant oder nützlich für Sie sein wird. Teilen von Material – Sie können Ihr Konto nicht völlig privat gestalten. Allerdings können Sie alle Ihre Tracks, Wiedergabelisten und andere Uploads als privat kennzeichnen. Das bedeutet, dass niemand ohne Ihre ausdrückliche Erlaubnis auf Ihre Tracks zugreifen und sie anhören kann. Mehr über diese Einstellungen erfahren Sie hier . Anwendungen von Drittanbietern – Wenn Sie Ihr Konto mit einer Anwendung eines Drittanbieters wie Meta oder Google verbunden haben, können Sie die Berechtigung für die Anwendung deaktivieren. Dazu müssen Sie Ihre Einstellungen auf der Registerkarte „Konto“ anpassen. Externe Entwickler – SoundCloud verfügt über eine offene API, über die externe Entwickler coole Apps als Erweiterung der Plattform entwickeln können. Wenn Sie nicht möchten, dass Ihre Tracks externen App-Entwicklern zur Verfügung gestellt werden, können Sie den API-Zugang für jeden hochgeladenen Track auf der entsprechenden SoundCloud-Seite deaktivieren. Klicken Sie auf das Bleistift-Symbol unter dem Wellenform-Player, navigieren Sie zur Registerkarte „Berechtigungen“ und deaktivieren Sie das Kontrollkästchen „App-Wiedergabe aktivieren“. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Ihre öffentlichen Profilinformationen trotzdem noch zugänglich sind. Dies gilt jedoch nicht für Dinge, die nicht öffentlich auf der Plattform verfügbar ist. Löschen Ihres SoundCloud-Kontos – Wenn Sie ein Konto haben und dieses löschen möchten, können Sie dies tun, indem Sie Ihre entsprechenden Einstellungen auf der Registerkarte „Konto“ anpassen. Wenn Sie Ihr Konto löschen, werden alle mit Ihrem Konto verbundenen persönlichen Daten (mit Ausnahme von Sicherungskopien), einschließlich der von Ihnen hochgeladenen Tracks und der mit diesen Tracks verbundenen Nutzungsdaten, gelöscht und können möglicherweise nicht wiederhergestellt werden. Wir empfehlen Ihnen daher, alle in Ihr Konto hochgeladenen Materialien vor der Löschung zu kopieren oder zu sichern. Selbst wenn Sie Ihr Konto löschen, ist es möglich, dass Ihre persönlichen Daten noch für kurze Zeit in einigen Internet-Suchergebnissen auftauchen, sofern die jeweilige Suchmaschine einen temporären Zwischenspeicher (Cache) für Webseiten unterhält. Die Caching-Prozesse von Suchmaschinen liegen außerhalb der Kontrolle von SoundCloud. Daher können wir nicht für personenbezogene Daten verantwortlich gemacht werden, die von Suchmaschinen zwischengespeichert werden, nachdem diese personenbezogenen Daten von der Plattform entfernt wurden. Bitte beachten Sie, dass das Löschen von SoundCloud-Apps oder Apps von Drittanbietern, mit denen Ihr Konto verbunden ist, nicht zum Löschen Ihres Kontos führt. Wenn Sie eine App eines Drittanbieters löschen, die über unsere API mit Ihrem Konto verbunden ist, werden dadurch nicht unbedingt alle personenbezogenen Daten über Ihre Aktivitäten auf der Plattform aus dieser App des Drittanbieters gelöscht. Sie müssen in den Nutzungsbedingungen und der Datenschutzrichtlinie des App-Anbieters nachlesen, wie Sie personenbezogene Daten über Ihre Aktivitäten auf der Plattform aus dieser Drittanbieter-App löschen können. Nachrichten von anderen Benutzern – Wenn Sie keine Nachrichten von Nutzern erhalten möchten, denen Sie nicht folgen, können Sie Ihre Einstellungen auf der Registerkarte „Datenschutz“ anpassen. Wenn Sie Nutzer blockieren möchten, müssen Sie dies in deren jeweiligen Profilen tun. Jeder blockierte Nutzer wird in Ihren Einstellungen auf der Registerkarte „Privatsphäre“ angezeigt. Verwaltung der Geräteeinstellungen Deaktivieren Sie auf Ihrem iOS-Mobilgerät die Einstellung „Apps erlauben, Tracking anzufordern“ oder die Einstellung „Werbepersonalisierung ausschalten“ für Ihr Android-Mobilgerät. Mit den Einstellungen Ihres Geräts können Sie auch die Standortnutzung bei der Verwendung von Apps ausschalten. Sie können Mobilgerät-Analysen und Fehlerberichte über dieselbe Einstellung ebenfalls deaktivieren. Verwalten von Browsereinstellungen Sie können Cookies auch über die Einstellungen Ihres Browsers steuern. Sie können Ihre Einstellungen in den meisten Webbrowsern so anpassen, dass Cookies akzeptiert oder abgelehnt werden, oder dass jedes Mal beim Setzen eines Cookies Ihre Erlaubnis eingeholt wird. Sie können auch jederzeit zuvor gespeicherte Cookies manuell löschen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass beim Blockieren von Cookies die Funktion der Plattform oder bestimmter Elemente eingeschränkt werden kann. Ausübung Ihrer EU-Datenschutzrechte Wenn Sie ein Nutzer mit Wohnsitz in der EU/EWR sind, können Sie alle in diesem Abschnitt beschriebenen Rechte über das Help Center oder durch Kontaktaufnahme über dataprotection@soundcloud.com ausüben. Bitte beachten Sie, dass wir Sie vor der Bearbeitung Ihrer Anfrage möglicherweise um eine Bestätigung Ihrer Identität bitten. Datenzugang und Übertragbarkeit – Sie haben unter Umständen das Recht, Kopien Ihrer bei uns gespeicherten personenbezogenen Daten anzufordern. Viele der personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen, sind in Ihren Kontoeinstellungen einsehbar. Sie haben aber auch das Recht, Kopien der personenbezogenen Daten anzufordern, die Sie uns in maschinenlesbarem Format zur Verfügung gestellt haben. Änderung oder Korrektur von Daten – Wenn Sie personenbezogene Daten nicht selbst über ein Konto aktualisieren können, sind Sie berechtigt, uns um die Korrektur, Änderung, Aktualisierung oder Berichtigung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu bitten. Aufbewahrung und Löschung von Daten – Wir bewahren personenbezogene Daten in der Regel so lange auf, wie es für die Erbringung von Dienstleistungen im Rahmen Ihres Kontos erforderlich ist, d. h. solange Ihr Vertrag läuft und aus Gründen rechtlicher Verpflichtungen für 3 Jahre nach dem Ende des Jahres, in dem Ihr Vertrag gekündigt wurde – oder so lange, wie es für die Bereitstellung der Plattform für Sie als nicht registrierter Nutzer erforderlich ist. Sie haben das Recht, uns zur Löschung aller oder eines Teils der über Sie erfassten personenbezogenen Daten aufzufordern. Wenn Sie ein Konto haben, können Sie Ihr Konto auch jederzeit über die Einstellungen löschen, wie unten beschrieben. Es kann sein, dass wir einige Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten auch nach der Löschung Ihres Kontos aufbewahren müssen, wenn dies erforderlich ist, um unseren rechtlichen Verpflichtungen nachzukommen (z. B. nach geltendem Steuer- oder Handelsrecht oder zur Verhinderung von Betrug und Missbrauch und zur Aufrechterhaltung und Verbesserung der Sicherheit). Danach löschen wir die personenbezogenen Daten unverzüglich, es sei denn, wir benötigen die personenbezogenen Daten bis zum Ablauf der gesetzlichen Verjährungsfrist zum Zwecke der Beweisführung für zivilrechtliche Ansprüche oder aufgrund gesetzlicher Aufbewahrungspflichten (z. B. aus buchhalterischen Gründen). Einspruch gegen die Verarbeitung – Sie haben das Recht, der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten aus Gründen, die sich aus Ihrer besonderen Situation ergeben, jederzeit zu widersprechen (insbesondere, wenn wir die personenbezogenen Daten nicht verarbeiten müssen, um eine vertragliche oder sonstige gesetzliche Verpflichtung zu erfüllen, oder wenn wir die personenbezogenen Daten auf der Grundlage unserer berechtigten Interessen verwenden). Wenn Sie einer solchen Verarbeitung widersprechen, wird SoundCloud Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr für diese Zwecke verarbeiten, es sei denn, wir können zwingende berechtigte Gründe für eine solche Verarbeitung nachweisen oder die Verarbeitung ist für die Begründung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen oder entsprechenden Verpflichtungen erforderlich. Werden Ihre personenbezogenen Daten zu Zwecken des Direktmarketings verarbeitet, haben Sie das Recht, dieser Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten jederzeit zu widersprechen und SoundCloud aufzufordern, die Verarbeitung Ihrer Daten zu diesen Zwecken einzustellen. Bitte beachten Sie jedoch, dass ein Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung nicht notwendigerweise Auswirkungen auf die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten vor dem Widerspruch hat. Eine solche Verarbeitung wird daher im Allgemeinen als zulässig angesehen und unterliegt den üblichen Aufbewahrungs- und Löschungsfristen. Einschränkung der Verarbeitung – Sie haben das Recht, die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten einzuschränken, wenn einer der folgenden Fälle auf Sie zutrifft: Ihre personenbezogenen Daten sind nicht mehr zutreffend; die Verarbeitung ist unrechtmäßig und statt der Löschung der personenbezogenen Daten beantragen Sie die Einschränkung der Nutzung; die personenbezogenen Daten werden nicht mehr von uns benötigt, werden aber von Ihnen zur Feststellung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen benötigt; Sie haben der Nutzung widersprochen und die Entscheidung über die berechtigten Gründe für den Widerspruch steht noch aus. Widerruf der Einwilligung – Wenn Sie in die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten durch SoundCloud eingewilligt haben, können Sie Ihre Einwilligung jederzeit widerrufen. Dazu müssen Sie Ihre Kontoeinstellungen ändern oder eine Mitteilung an SoundCloud senden, in der Sie angeben, welche Einwilligung Sie widerrufen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass der Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung die Rechtmäßigkeit von Verarbeitungen, die auf einer solchen Einwilligung vor deren Widerruf beruhen, nicht berührt. Einreichung von Beschwerden – Sie haben das Recht, bei einer zuständigen Datenschutzbehörde Beschwerden über die Datenverarbeitung durch SoundCloud einzureichen. Eine Liste der EU-Datenschutzbehörden finden Sie hier .

Wenn Sie ein passwortgeschütztes Konto bei uns unterhalten, können wir Ihre Identität anhand unserer bestehenden Authentifizierungsverfahren für Ihr Konto überprüfen und Sie auffordern, sich erneut zu authentifizieren, bevor wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten offenlegen oder löschen.

In its research laboratories, workshops, libraries, and administration, scientists and researchers perform demanding tasks with a high degree of autonomy and creativity. The working environment is both open and stimulating – and international! Not surprisingly, the appeal of the Max Planck Society has achieved international fame. More than a third of around 12,000 scientists hold a foreign passport. They form a creative cosmos in which interdisciplinary and intercultural concepts and ideas of great minds come to bear. This, in turn, ensures the success of the excellent basic research for which our organisation is renowned. We promote accomplished junior scientists, who complete formative years of their careers as student assistants, Ph.D. students, postdocs or research group heads at Max Planck institutes, and who benefit from the knowledge of their internationally networking scientific mentors. We are also committed to providing young people with a sound basis in various skilled trades. Facilitating the career ascent of female scientists has been a priority for us for over a decade now. The Max Planck Society boasts the highest number of women on a scientific staff in Germany – even in leading positions. Our family-friendly staff policy carries a seal of quality. As the first German research organisation, our institutes were granted the logo of the non-profit organisation berufundfamilie (“career and family”). Institute jobs Nomination sought for the position of Director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems Stuttgart & Tübingen The MPI for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart and Tübingen expects to have an opening for one director and scientific member of the Max Planck Society (MPG) in each site. The Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems combines – within one center – theory, software, and hardware expertise in the research field of intelligent systems. The opening for the Tübingen campus of the institute relates to areas like machine learning, including modern robotics, and natural language understanding. Research at the Stuttgart campus of the institute relates to small-scale robotics, self-organization, haptic perception, bio-inspired systems, medical robotics, and robotic materials.

The institute is situated in the north wing of Hohentübingen Castle, a medieval fortress rebuilt during Renaissance and adapted as part of the University in the late 1990ies, atop the Schloßberg, towering above the Old Town. The Institute of Classical Archaeology at Tübigen is among the oldest departments in Germany. It was founded in 1865 when Adolf Michaelis was hired as Professor of Archaeology at Tübingen. Today, the Institute is one of the leading departments in the field of archaeology in Germany. In the 2023 QS worldwide ranking , Tübingen was ranked 14th in the field of Archaeology as leading German-speaking institute. Study and Research Study and Research The castle is one of the most attractive historic landmarks of Tübingen and home to the Institute of Classical Archaeology, Egyptology, Near Eastern Archaeology, Prehistory, and Anthropology, furnishing students and scholars with a variety of strong research libraries. The castle is also home to the archaeology and anthropology collection of the museum of the University of Tübingen, housing renowned collections of European prehistory, Egyptology, Mediterranean and Near Eastern archaeology and anthropology, the cast collection as well as the department of coins and medals. The museum and its rich collections provide students with a unique chance to study material culture from genuine ancient objects. The departments of ancient history, art history, classics and religious studies and their excellent libraries at the foot of the Schloßberg and in the in the Old Town round off an outstanding environment to study Greek and Roman archaeology at Tübingen. Profile Profile With more than ten faculty members – even though the Ancient World is the Institute’s sole scholarly focus –, the Institute of Classical Archaeology at Tübingen is among the larger departments in Germany. The department’s research strengths include the study of sculpture, architecture, and pottery studies with geographical emphasis on Greece, Turkey, and Italy. Through various research projects, the Institute actively engages with the collections in the university museum and annually conducts archaeological excavations and surveys in the Mediterranean. Current research projects deal with iconographic studies and fieldwork, ranging from Early Greek to Late Antique period in Turkey, Greece, Carthage, Pompeii, and Rome. Additionally, the Institute of Classical Archaeology at Tübingen provides the unique chance to their students to combine the study of archaeology with ancient numismatics . Being a hotspot for producing cutting edge research in archaeology, the Institute regularly organises workshops, symposia and conferences and constantly hosts international leading visiting scholars.

The Weltethos Institute (also Global Ethic Institute) is a research and teaching institution at the University of Tübingen with the aim of anchoring value orientation and trust in business and society. The focus is on offering competence in learning about identity and encounter, as well as ethical language and action in the age of globalization. As part of Hans Küng’s “ Global Ethic Project “, the Institute addresses the following question in various ways: Under what conditions can we survive together in cultural, ideological and religious diversity on an habitable earth and shape our individual and social life in a humane way? To this end, dialogue learning programmes are developed for students and people in organisations and companies. For example, the Global Ethic Ambassador Program for managers or our World Citizen School’s Social Innovation Program for young leaders and student initiatives. Through research, teaching and transfer into practice, we are committed in this way to a culture of sustainable economic activity for fellow citizens, the environment and posterity. The director of the institute is theologian and entrepreneur Prof. Dr. Dr. Ulrich Hemel . The institute is supported by the Karl Schlecht Foundation .

Die Professuren Quantitative Proteomics (Macek, Biologie), Molekulare Zellbiologie (Ewald, Biologie) und Seniorprofessur Molekularbiologie (Nordheim, Biologie), bilden das IZB. Die Forschung konzentriert sich inhaltlich auf die Gebiete der molekularen Zellbiologie (Zellzyklus, Autophagie), Genom- und Proteombiologie und Zellbiologie entwicklungsbiologischer Systeme. Die gewählten zellbiologischen Themenstellungen ergänzen sich in idealer Weise mit den zellbiologischen Forschungsfragen der Exzellenzcluster „Controlling Microbes to Fight Infection" (CMFI), „Image-guided and Functionally Instructed Tumor Therapies“ (iFIT), sowie der Schwerpunkte „Neurobiologie" und „Molekularbiologie der Pflanzen".

Special attention is given to Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and rare movement disorders such as ataxias. As a result, the Tübingen experts are studying nerve-damaging inflammatory processes in the brain as well as hereditary factors that can play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, as some gene variants can increase the risk of disease or even directly trigger a disease, while other variants protect against it. At the DZNE Tübingen, researchers therefore hope to discover such risk and protection factors in order to pave the way for new measures in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Our research aims to enable earlier diagnosis and better treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Prof. Thomas Gasser Site speaker (acting) at DZNE Tübingen Through human clinical observation and threapy studies, scientists at the DZNE in Tübingen are also working on a better method for early detection of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ataxias, and on new therapeutic measures. To this end, they are examining the research participants to find biomarkers, which are measurable biological indicators (in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid, for example) that can be used to detect a disease and assess how it will progress. Clinical research in Tübingen is also dedicated to the rare, hereditary form of Parkinson’s disease. Your commitment can make a big difference!

We both develop ML tools for neural data analysis and take inspiration from the brain about what key problems to solve in ML and also how to tackle them. The brain excels in autonomous learning from unlabeled data streams. While machine learning is rapidly advancing toward learning with unlabeled or weakly labeled datasets, autonomous knowledge accumulation through continuous data collection is largely missing. To address this discrepancy, we develop mathematical concepts, build machine learning systems, and compare machines to brains in terms of their representational structure and learning algorithms. Our previous research on these topics can be summarized under the following headings: Representation learning for compression, disentangling, and o.o.d. robustness Lifelong learning requires making experiences in the past reusable for the future. Representations of these experiences need to be memory efficient (compressed) and compositional (disentangled) to facilitate reliable one-shot generalization to new situations that cannot be regarded as samples from a known distribution (Out-of-distribution robustness). Probabilistic inference and o.o.d. or few-shot generalization benchmarking Benchmarking is a fundamental tool for evaluating the ability of an ML algorithm to generalize from previous experience to new situations. The academic standard concept of training and testing with samples from the same distribution does not capture the robustness of biological learning systems acting in an open world. We frequently work on benchmarks to improve the comparability of models and avoid shortcut learning. Generative and explainable modeling methods Discriminative methods learn to map data to labels but different models with identical i.i.d. test performance may use completely different features for decision making. This can be demonstrated e.g. by the use of carefully designed architectures that exclude the use of certain features. In addition, we use generative methods such as adversarial, controversial, or style transfer stimuli that can help to reveal the features used by a neural network, or that are used during inference (analysis-by-synthesis). Sometimes these methods also facilitate aesthetically compelling image manipulations similar to artistic styles. Behavioral data analysis, modeling, and tools We collect and use behavioral data to predict where people look and what features they use for visual decision making and memorization. We also built tools for tracking lifelong natural behavior such as keypoint extraction. We collaborate with Felix Wichmann, Alexander Mathis, Ralf Engbert, and Christoph Teufel. Neural data analysis, modeling, and tools We develop machine learning models for neural data analysis to identify the function of biological neurons for inference and learning in the brain (mostly mammalian retina and visual cortex). We are particularly interested in understanding distributed processing in populations of neurons and building tools for automatic model extraction such as functional cell type identification. We collaborate with Thomas Euler, Andreas Tolias and Mackenzie Mathis. AI sciencepreneurship and startups Machine learning is rapidly expanding the range of skills that can be used for new solutions to relevant problems in the world either by being more scalable or more precise then human labor. We seek to develop a better understanding of how we can develop economically feasible solutions that best address long-term human needs. We spin off and collaborate with startups such as Maddox AI, Vara, or Aleph Alpha. News Two Day Lab Hackathon 2023 Innovative research, collaboration, and fun are at the core of our lab’s mission. At our recent two-day hackathon we explored cutting-edge ideas on group actions, object-centric learning, and stable diffusion.

Tea Talk Probabilistic Numerics Computational Imaging Scientific discussions The type of inference can vary, including for instance inductive learning (estimation of models such as functional dependencies that generalize to novel data sampled from the same underlying distribution), or the inference of causal structures from statistical data (leading to models that provide insight into the underlying mechanisms, and make predictions about the effect of interventions). Likewise, the type of empirical data can vary, ranging from sparse experimental measurements (e. g., microarray data) to visual patterns. Our department is conducting theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental studies to try and understand the problem of empirical inference.

This covers the ways that humans and other animals come to choose appropriate and sometimes inappropriate actions in the face of rewards and punishments, and the ways and goals of the process by which they come to form neural representations of the world. The models are informed and constrained by neurobiological, psychological and ethological data. We also study the consequences for neurological and psychiatric disease when these mechanisms, or their embedding in their environment, break down. These areas are developing and expanding very quickly because of technical innovations in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, psychiatry and in large-scale natural experiments. We perform behavioural and neuroimaging experiments of our own, and work in close collaborations with a panoply of other experimental and theoretical groups. There are three main current directions: neuromodulation, neural reinforcement learning and computational psychiatry. Neuromodulation The neuromodulators dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and norepinephrine powerfully regulate a host of critical functions in the brain, and are involved or therapeutically manipulated in many diseases. Ideas abound about the functional associates of these substances - their representation of computationally meaningful quantities such as predictions of, and prediction errors for, affectively important outcomes, and different sorts of uncertainty. New technologies for recording and manipulating these neuromodulators are being developed; we exploit these to address critical questions about their function. Neural Reinforcement Learning Neural reinforcement learning covers the core theory, algorithms and implementations of adaptive decision-making. These include meta-control, which is the control of control - the way that decision-making systems in the brain are themselves regulated online and offline in order to generate adaptive behaviour in the face of substantial real and opportunity costs for the engagement of the neural machinery involved. We also study ways of creating and adapting representations, aspects of the utility afforded to states and the associated risk-sensitivity; the nature and effect of the social environments of decision-makers. We develop new, computationally-informed, behavioural tasks, and adopt new imaging analysis methods to examine these processes in functional and temporal detail. Computational Psychiatry Our understanding of decision-making in the healthy population has now advanced to the point that we can use it to investigate characteristic modes of failure. This provides precise, process- and circuit-oriented hypotheses for understanding symptoms and causes of mental dysfunction. In turn, this richly couples notionally organic and psychological concerns, and provides new methods for classification and prediction. In turn, as we deepen our understanding of failure modes, an important window is opened onto normal cognition.

One central goal of AI research is to build intelligent systems that exceed the capabilities of biological brains. However, to date we know very little about how computations in neuronal circuits give rise to biological intelligence. Our group uses AI both as a testbed and a tool on large scale neuro-physiological and -anatomical data to better understand the constituent elements of neuronal intelligence. We are inspired by the idea that a deeper understanding of computational motifs in cortical circuits can help build the next generation of intelligent systems. We are based at the University Göttingen and the University Tübingen as part of the Cybervalley initiative. We closely collaborate with experimental and computational neuroscientists to develop new tools and experimental paradigms to discover principles of biological intelligence.

We have shown that the effects of locomotion extend throughout the mouse early visual system, where it affects pupil size, and modulates the activity of dLGN and decorrelates responses in primary visual cortex ( Erisken et al. 2014 ). In a new project embedded in the SFB 870 , we follow up on this work and consider the effects of locomotion within the thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop. Together with Aman Saleem (UCL), we have organized a Mini-Symposium at SfN 2017 that has discussed novel perspectives of sensory processing during active, multi-dimensional behavior in different systems (fly vision, rodent vision, audition, somatosensation) and at different processing levels (fly lobula plate, mammalian thalamus and cortex). Cortico-thalamic feedback As an ideal model circuit to understand the role of feedback in the visual system, we study how cortico-thalamic feedback modulates activity in the dorsolateral geniculate (dLGN) of the thalamus and in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). In ongoing projects, we work with transgenic mice expression Cre-recombinase in L6 cortico-thalamic pyramidal cells and use optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to causally probe their impact on thalamic activity (Funded by DFG). In collaboration with Thomas Euler (2-photon Calcium imaging of the retina; CIN University of Tübingen) and Philipp Berens (computational modeling; CIN, University of Tübingen) we study how feedforward and feedback signals control activity in the dLGN. (Funded by BCCN Smart Start and DFG) Neural basis of visual behavior Neural activity, even in early sensory areas, is modulated by visual behavior ( Khastkhodaei et al. 2016 ; Saleem et al. 2017 ) In the past, we have shown that visual behavior in mice does not only reflect stimulus properties, but can also heavily be influenced by non-sensory factors, such as past rewards or past choices ( Busse et al. 2011 ). In a new project within the RTG Perception in Context 2175, we will follow up on this observation and combine electrophysiological recordings, optogenetics and computational modeling (in collaboration with Thomas Wachtler, LMU) to gain a deeper understanding in the neural circuits and mechanism underlying history-dependent visual processing. In collaborative work with Steffen Katzner’s lab and Masataka Watanabe (MPI for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen), we train mice in complex visual tasks and ask how neural activity changes in the context of behavior. Furthermore, we perturb neural responses using optogenetic tools to identify the circuits that are critical for a perceptual task. top The role of inhibitory interneurons in visual processing The appropriate relationship between excitation and inhibition is crucial for normal brain function, including the processing of visual information. In the past, we have shown that parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) inhibitory interneurons in primary visual cortex contribute to contextual modulations, potentially via controlling stimulus drive ( Vaiceliunaite et al. 2013 ). In a new project embedded in the DFG-funded priority program “Computational Connectomics”, we study in collaboration with Dr. Tatjana Tchumatchenko at the MPI for Brain Research in Frankfurt the role of inhibitory interneurons in contrast-invariance in primary visual cortex. Alterations of inhibitory activity have also been proposed to underlie several neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia. In ongoing work, we investigate the impact of impaired inhibitory circuits on network oscillations and visual processing. Natural stimuli for mice Across species, visual systems have evolved to efficiently cope with the specific information encountered in the animal’s natural habitat. Visual stimuli that are matched to natural conditions are therefore essential to understand how neurons process visual information. In a newly funded project with Thomas Euler (CIN, University of Tübingen) and Frank Schaeffel (CIN, University of Tübingen), we will explore the visual input received by the mouse visual system under natural conditions and how such input is processed along key stages of the early visual system.
